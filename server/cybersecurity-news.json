Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they&#8217;ll do &#8212; such as destroying stolen data.</p>\n<p>Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that &#8212; to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim&#8217;s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.</p>\n<p>SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/expansion-shinyhunters-saas-data-theft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a January 30 blog post</a>, Google&#8217;s security forensics firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> said SLSH&#8217;s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,&#8221; the blog post explained.</p>\n<p>Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.</p>\n<p>Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to &#8220;swatting&#8221; attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target&#8217;s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A big part of what they&#8217;re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives&#8217; kids and threatening the board of the company,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they&#8217;re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, &#8216;Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we&#8217;re going to write about you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.unit221b.com/dont-read-this-blog/harassment-scare-tactics-why-victims-should-never-pay-shinyhunters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a blog post today</a>, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep.

In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and &#8220;promise&#8221; to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word.
