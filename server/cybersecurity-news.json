    "content:encoded": "<p>Leaders of many organizations are urging their teams to adopt agentic AI to improve efficiency, but are finding it hard to achieve any benefit. Managers attempting to add AI agents to existing human teams may find that bots fail to faithfully follow their instructions, return pointless or obvious results or burn precious time and resources spinning on tasks that older, simpler systems could have accomplished just as well.</p>\n<p>The technical innovators getting the most out of AI are finding that the technology can be remarkably human in its behavior. And the more groups of AI agents are given tasks that require cooperation and collaboration, the more those human-like dynamics emerge.</p>\n<p>Our research suggests that, because of how directly they seem to apply to hybrid teams of human and digital workers, the most effective leaders in the coming years may still be those who excel at understanding the timeworn principles of human management.</p>\n<p>We have spent years studying the risks and opportunities for organizations adopting AI. Our 2025 book, <em>Rewiring Democracy</em>, examines lessons from AI adoption in government institutions and civil society worldwide. In it, we identify where the technology has made the biggest impact and where it fails to make a difference. Today, we see many of the organizations we&#8217;ve studied taking another shot at AI adoption&#8212;this time, with agentic tools. While generative AI generates, <em>agentic AI </em>acts and achieves goals such as automating supply chain processes, making data-driven investment decisions or managing complex project workflows. The cutting edge of AI development research is starting to reveal what works best in this new paradigm.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Agentic AI</h3>\n<p>There are four key areas where AI should reliably boast superhuman performance: in speed, scale, scope and sophistication. Again and again, the most impactful AI applications leverage their capabilities in one or more of these areas. Think of content-moderation AI that can scan thousands of posts in an instant, legislative policy tools that can scale deliberations to millions of constituents, and protein-folding AI that can model molecular interactions with greater sophistication than any biophysicist.</p>\n<p>Equally, AI applications that don&#8217;t leverage these core capabilities typically fail to impress. For example, Google&#8217;s AI Overviews irritate many of its users when the overviews obscure information that could be more efficiently consumed straight from the web results that the AI attempted to synthesize.</p>\n<p>Agentic AI extends these core advantages of AI to new tasks and scenarios. The most familiar AI tools are chatbots, image generators and other models that take a single action: ask one question, get one answer. Agentic systems solve more complex problems by using many such AI models and giving each one the capability to use tools like retrieving information from databases and perform tasks like sending emails or executing financial transactions.</p>\n<p>Because agentic systems are so new and their potential configurations so vast, we are still learning which business processes they will fit well with and which they will not. Gartner has estimated that 40 per cent of agentic AI projects will be cancelled within two years, largely because they are targeted where they can&#8217;t achieve meaningful business impact.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Agentic AI behavior</h3>\n<p>To understand the collective behaviors of agentic AI systems, we need to examine the individual AIs that comprise them. When AIs make mistakes or make things up, they can behave in ways that are truly bizarre. But when they work well, the reasons why are sometimes surprisingly relatable.</p>\n<p>Tools like ChatGPT drew attention by sounding human. Moreover, individual AIs often behave like individual people, responding to incentives and organizing their own work in much the same ways that humans do. Recall the counterintuitive findings of many early users of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) in 2022: They seemed to perform better when offered a cash tip, told the answer was really important or were threatened with hypothetical punishments.</p>\n<p>One of the most effective and enduring techniques discovered in those early days of LLM testing was &#8216;chain-of-thought prompting,&#8217; which instructed AIs to think through and explain each step of their analysis&#8212;much like a teacher forcing a student to show their work. Individual AIs can also react to new information similar to individual people. Researchers have found that LLMs can be effective at simulating the opinions of individual people or demographic groups on diverse topics, including consumer preferences and politics.</p>\n<p>As agentic AI develops, we are finding that groups of AIs also exhibit human-like behaviors collectively. A 2025 paper found that communities of thousands of AI agents set to chat with each other developed familiar human social behaviors like settling into echo chambers. Other researchers have observed the emergence of cooperative and competitive strategies and the development of distinct behavioral roles when setting groups of AIs to play a game together.</p>\n<p>The fact that groups of agentic AIs are working more like human teams doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate that machines have inherently human-like characteristics. It may be more nurture than nature: AIs are being designed with inspiration from humans. The breakthrough triumph of ChatGPT was widely attributed to using human feedback during training. Since then, AI developers have gotten better at aligning AI models to human expectations. It stands to reason, then, that we may find similarities between the management techniques that work for human workers and for agentic AI.</p>\n<h3>Lessons From the Frontier</h3>\n<p>So, how best to manage hybrid teams of humans and agentic AIs? Lessons can be gleaned from leading AI labs. In a recent research report, Anthropic shared the practical roadmap and published lessons learned while building its Claude Research feature, which uses teams of multiple AI agents to accomplish complex reasoning tasks. For example, using agents to search the web for information and calling external tools to access information from sources like emails and documents.</p>\n<p>Advancements in agentic AI enabling new offerings like Claude Research and Amazon Q are causing a stir among AI practitioners because they reveal insights from the frontlines of AI research about how to make agentic AI and the hybrid organizations that leverage it more effective. What is striking about Anthropic&#8217;s report is how transparent it is about all the hard-won lessons learned in developing its offering&#8212;and the fact that many of these lessons sound a lot like what we find in classic management texts:</p>\n<h5>LESSON 1: DELEGATION MATTERS.</h5>\n<p>When Anthropic analyzed what factors lead to excellent performance by Claude Research, it turned out that the best agentic systems weren&#8217;t necessarily built on the best or most expensive AI models. Rather, like a good human manager, they need to excel at breaking down and distributing tasks to their digital workers.</p>\n<p>Unlike human teams, agentic systems can enlist as many AI workers as needed, onboard them instantly and immediately set them to work. Organizations that can exploit this scalability property of AI will gain a key advantage, but the hard part is assigning each of them to contribute meaningful, complementary work to the overall project.</p>\n<p>In classical management, this is called delegation. Any good manager knows that, even if they have the most experience and the strongest skills of anyone on their team, they can&#8217;t do it all alone. Delegation is necessary to harness the collective capacity of their team. It turns out this is crucial to AI, too.</p>\n<p>The authors explain this result in terms of &#8216;parallelization&#8217;: Being able to separate the work into small chunks allows many AI agents to contribute work simultaneously, each focusing on one piece of the problem. The research report attributes 80 per cent of the performance differences between agentic AI systems to the total amount of computing resources they leverage.</p>\n<p>Whether or not each individual agent is the smartest in the digital toolbox, the collective has more capacity for reasoning when there are many AI &#8216;hands&#8217; working together. In addition to the quality of the output, teams working in parallel get work done faster. Anthropic says that reconfiguring its AI agents to work in parallel improved research speed by 90 per cent.</p>\n<p>Anthropic&#8217;s report on how to orchestrate agentic systems effectively reads like a classical delegation training manual: Provide a clear objective, specify the output you expect and provide guidance on what tools to use, and set boundaries.

Anthropic&#8217;s most intelligent Opus model takes the Lead Researcher role, while their cheaper and faster Sonnet model fulfills the more numerous sub-agent roles. Anthropic has analyzed how to distribute responsibility and share information across its digital worker network.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Leaders of many organizations are urging their teams to adopt agentic AI to improve efficiency, but are finding it hard to achieve any benefit. Managers attempting to add AI agents to existing human teams may find that bots fail to faithfully follow their instructions, return pointless or obvious results or burn precious time and resources spinning on tasks that older, simpler systems could have accomplished just as well.\nThe technical innovators getting the most out of AI are finding that the technology can be remarkably human in its behavior. And the more groups of AI agents are given tasks that require cooperation and collaboration, the more those human-like dynamics emerge.\nOur research suggests that, because of how directly they seem to apply to hybrid teams of human and digital workers, the most effective leaders in the coming years may still be those who excel at understanding the timeworn principles of human management.\nWe have spent years studying the risks and opportunities for organizations adopting AI. Our 2025 book, Rewiring Democracy, examines lessons from AI adoption in government institutions and civil society worldwide. In it, we identify where the technology has made the biggest impact and where it fails to make a difference. Today, we see many of the organizations we’ve studied taking another shot at AI adoption—this time, with agentic tools. While generative AI generates, agentic AI acts and achieves goals such as automating supply chain processes, making data-driven investment decisions or managing complex project workflows. The cutting edge of AI development research is starting to reveal what works best in this new paradigm.\nUnderstanding Agentic AI\nThere are four key areas where AI should reliably boast superhuman performance: in speed, scale, scope and sophistication. Again and again, the most impactful AI applications leverage their capabilities in one or more of these areas. Think of content-moderation AI that can scan thousands of posts in an instant, legislative policy tools that can scale deliberations to millions of constituents, and protein-folding AI that can model molecular interactions with greater sophistication than any biophysicist.\nEqually, AI applications that don’t leverage these core capabilities typically fail to impress. For example, Google’s AI Overviews irritate many of its users when the overviews obscure information that could be more efficiently consumed straight from the web results that the AI attempted to synthesize.\nAgentic AI extends these core advantages of AI to new tasks and scenarios. The most familiar AI tools are chatbots, image generators and other models that take a single action: ask one question, get one answer. Agentic systems solve more complex problems by using many such AI models and giving each one the capability to use tools like retrieving information from databases and perform tasks like sending emails or executing financial transactions.\nBecause agentic systems are so new and their potential configurations so vast, we are still learning which business processes they will fit well with and which they will not. Gartner has estimated that 40 per cent of agentic AI projects will be cancelled within two years, largely because they are targeted where they can’t achieve meaningful business impact.\nUnderstanding Agentic AI behavior\nTo understand the collective behaviors of agentic AI systems, we need to examine the individual AIs that comprise them. When AIs make mistakes or make things up, they can behave in ways that are truly bizarre. But when they work well, the reasons why are sometimes surprisingly relatable.\nTools like ChatGPT drew attention by sounding human. Moreover, individual AIs often behave like individual people, responding to incentives and organizing their own work in much the same ways that humans do. Recall the counterintuitive findings of many early users of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) in 2022: They seemed to perform better when offered a cash tip, told the answer was really important or were threatened with hypothetical punishments.\nOne of the most effective and enduring techniques discovered in those early days of LLM testing was ‘chain-of-thought prompting,’ which instructed AIs to think through and explain each step of their analysis—much like a teacher forcing a student to show their work. Individual AIs can also react to new information similar to individual people. Researchers have found that LLMs can be effective at simulating the opinions of individual people or demographic groups on diverse topics, including consumer preferences and politics.\nAs agentic AI develops, we are finding that groups of AIs also exhibit human-like behaviors collectively. A 2025 paper found that communities of thousands of AI agents set to chat with each other developed familiar human social behaviors like settling into echo chambers. Other researchers have observed the emergence of cooperative and competitive strategies and the development of distinct behavioral roles when setting groups of AIs to play a game together.\nThe fact that groups of agentic AIs are working more like human teams doesn’t necessarily indicate that machines have inherently human-like characteristics. It may be more nurture than nature: AIs are being designed with inspiration from humans. The breakthrough triumph of ChatGPT was widely attributed to using human feedback during training. Since then, AI developers have gotten better at aligning AI models to human expectations. It stands to reason, then, that we may find similarities between the management techniques that work for human workers and for agentic AI.\nLessons From the Frontier\nSo, how best to manage hybrid teams of humans and agentic AIs? Lessons can be gleaned from leading AI labs. In a recent research report, Anthropic shared the practical roadmap and published lessons learned while building its Claude Research feature, which uses teams of multiple AI agents to accomplish complex reasoning tasks. For example, using agents to search the web for information and calling external tools to access information from sources like emails and documents.\nAdvancements in agentic AI enabling new offerings like Claude Research and Amazon Q are causing a stir among AI practitioners because they reveal insights from the frontlines of AI research about how to make agentic AI and the hybrid organizations that leverage it more effective. What is striking about Anthropic’s report is how transparent it is about all the hard-won lessons learned in developing its offering—and the fact that many of these lessons sound a lot like what we find in classic management texts:\nLESSON 1: DELEGATION MATTERS.\nWhen Anthropic analyzed what factors lead to excellent performance by Claude Research, it turned out that the best agentic systems weren’t necessarily built on the best or most expensive AI models. Rather, like a good human manager, they need to excel at breaking down and distributing tasks to their digital workers.\nUnlike human teams, agentic systems can enlist as many AI workers as needed, onboard them instantly and immediately set them to work. Organizations that can exploit this scalability property of AI will gain a key advantage, but the hard part is assigning each of them to contribute meaningful, complementary work to the overall project.\nIn classical management, this is called delegation. Any good manager knows that, even if they have the most experience and the strongest skills of anyone on their team, they can’t do it all alone. Delegation is necessary to harness the collective capacity of their team. It turns out this is crucial to AI, too.\nThe authors explain this result in terms of ‘parallelization’: Being able to separate the work into small chunks allows many AI agents to contribute work simultaneously, each focusing on one piece of the problem. The research report attributes 80 per cent of the performance differences between agentic AI systems to the total amount of computing resources they leverage.\nWhether or not each individual agent is the smartest in the digital toolbox, the collective has more capacity for reasoning when there are many AI ‘hands’ working together. In addition to the quality of the output, teams working in parallel get work done faster. Anthropic says that reconfiguring its AI agents to work in parallel improved research speed by 90 per cent.\nAnthropic’s report on how to orchestrate agentic systems effectively reads like a classical delegation training manual: Provide a clear objective, specify the output you expect and provide guidance on what tools to use, and set boundaries. When the objective and output format is not clear, workers may come back with irrelevant or irreconcilable information.\nLESSON 2: ITERATION MATTERS.\nEdison famously tested thousands of light bulb designs and filament materials before arriving at a workable solution. Likewise, successful agentic AI systems work far better when they are allowed to learn from their early attempts and then try again. Claude Research spawns a multitude of AI agents, each doubling and tripling back on their own work as they go through a trial-and-error process to land on the right results.\nThis is exactly how management researchers have recommended organizations staff novel projects where large teams are tasked with exploring unfamiliar terrain: Teams should split up and conduct trial-and-error learning, in parallel, like a pharmaceutical company progressing multiple molecules towards a potential clinical trial. Even when one candidate seems to have the strongest chances at the outset, there is no telling in advance which one will improve the most as it is iterated upon.\nThe advantage of using AI for this iterative process is speed: AI agents can complete and retry their tasks in milliseconds. A recent report from Microsoft Research illustrates this. Its agentic AI system launched up to five AI worker teams in a race to finish a task first, each plotting and pursuing its own iterative path to the destination. They found that a five-team system typically returned results about twice as fast as a single AI worker team with no loss in effectiveness, although at the cost of about twice as much total computing spend.\nGoing further, Claude Research’s system design endowed its top-level AI agent—the ‘Lead Researcher’—with the decision authority to delegate more research iterations if it was not satisfied with the results returned by its sub-agents. They managed the choice of whether or not they should continue their iterative search loop, to a limit. To the extent that agentic AI mirrors the world of human management, this might be one of the most important topics to watch going forward. Deciding when to stop and what is ‘good enough’ has always been one of the hardest problems organizations face.\nLESSON 3: EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SHARING MATTERS.\nIf you work in a manufacturing department, you wouldn’t rely on your division chief to explain the specs you need to meet for a new product. You would go straight to the source: the domain experts in R&D. Successful organizations need to be able to share complex information efficiently both vertically and horizontally.\nTo solve the horizontal sharing problem for Claude Research, Anthropic innovated a novel mechanism for AI agents to share their outputs directly with each other by writing directly to a common file system, like a corporate intranet.
