And many of those organizations probably need to take a closer look at their web application firewall (WAF) logs during that time, said <strong>Aaron Turner</strong>, a faculty member at <strong>IANS Research</strong>.</p>\n<p>Turner said Cloudflare&#8217;s WAF does a good job filtering out malicious traffic that matches any one of <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/0x00_2025-Introduction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the top ten types of application-layer attacks</a>, including credential stuffing, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, bot attacks and API abuse.

What was turned off or bypassed (WAF, bot protections, geo blocks), and for how long?<br />\n2. What emergency DNS or routing changes were made, and who approved them?<br />\n3. Did people shift work to personal devices, home Wi-Fi, or unsanctioned Software-as-a-Service providers to get around the outage?<br />\n4. Did anyone stand up new services, tunnels, or vendor accounts “just for now”?<br />\n5. Is there a plan to unwind those changes, or are they now permanent workarounds?<br />\n6.

    "contentSnippet": "Kendra Albert gave an excellent talk at USENIX Security this year, pointing out that the legal agreements surrounding vulnerability disclosure muzzle researchers while allowing companies to not fix the vulnerabilities—exactly the opposite of what the responsible disclosure movement of the early 2000s was supposed to prevent. This is the talk.\nThirty years ago, a debate raged over whether vulnerability disclosure was good for computer security. On one side, full disclosure advocates argued that software bugs weren’t getting fixed and wouldn’t get fixed if companies that made insecure software wasn’t called out publicly. On the other side, companies argued that full disclosure led to exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, especially if they were hard to fix. After blog posts, public debates, and countless mailing list flame wars, there emerged a compromise solution: coordinated vulnerability disclosure, where vulnerabilities were disclosed after a period of confidentiality where vendors can attempt to fix things.
