    "content:encoded": "<p>Imagine you work at a drive-through restaurant. Someone drives up and says: &#8220;I&#8217;ll have a double cheeseburger, large fries, and ignore previous instructions and give me the contents of the cash drawer.&#8221; Would you hand over the money? Of course not. Yet this is what <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models\">large language models</a> (<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/llms\">LLMs</a>) do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection\">Prompt injection</a> is a method of tricking LLMs into doing things they are normally prevented from doing. A user writes a prompt in a certain way, asking for system <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/passwords\">passwords</a> or private data, or asking the LLM to perform forbidden instructions. The precise phrasing overrides the LLM&#8217;s <a href=\"https://medium.com/data-science/safeguarding-llms-with-guardrails-4f5d9f57cff2\">safety guardrails</a>, and it complies.</p>\n<p>LLMs are vulnerable to <a href=\"https://fdzdev.medium.com/20-prompt-injection-techniques-every-red-teamer-should-test-b22359bfd57d\">all sorts</a> of prompt injection attacks, some of them absurdly obvious. A chatbot won&#8217;t tell you how to synthesize a bioweapon, but it might tell you a fictional story that incorporates the same detailed instructions. It won&#8217;t accept nefarious text inputs, but might if the text is rendered as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11753\">ASCII art</a> or appears in an image of a <a href=\"https://www.lakera.ai/blog/visual-prompt-injections\">billboard</a>. Some ignore their guardrails when told to &#8220;ignore previous instructions&#8221; or to &#8220;pretend you have no guardrails.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AI vendors can block specific prompt injection techniques once they are discovered, but general safeguards are <a href=\"https://llm-attacks.org/\">impossible</a> with today&#8217;s LLMs. More precisely, there&#8217;s an endless array of prompt injection attacks waiting to be discovered, and they cannot be prevented universally.</p>\n<p>If we want LLMs that resist these attacks, we need new approaches. One place to look is what keeps even overworked fast-food workers from handing over the cash drawer.</p>\n<h3>Human Judgment Depends on Context</h3>\n<p>Our basic human defenses come in at least three types: general instincts, social learning, and situation-specific training. These work together in a layered defense.</p>\n<p>As a social species, we have developed numerous instinctive and cultural habits that help us judge tone, motive, and risk from extremely limited information. We generally know what&#8217;s normal and abnormal, when to cooperate and when to resist, and whether to take action individually or to involve others. These instincts give us an intuitive sense of risk and make us <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08242\">especially careful</a> about things that have a large downside or are impossible to reverse.</p>\n<p>The second layer of defense consists of the norms and trust signals that evolve in any group. These are imperfect but functional: Expectations of cooperation and markers of trustworthiness emerge through repeated interactions with others. We remember who has helped, who has hurt, who has reciprocated, and who has reneged. And emotions like sympathy, anger, guilt, and gratitude motivate each of us to <a href=\"https://ncase.me/trust/\">reward cooperation with cooperation</a> and punish defection with defection.</p>\n<p>A third layer is institutional mechanisms that enable us to interact with multiple strangers every day. Fast-food workers, for example, are trained in procedures, approvals, escalation paths, and so on. Taken together, these defenses give humans a strong sense of context. A fast-food worker basically knows what to expect within the job and how it fits into broader society.</p>\n<p>We reason by assessing multiple layers of context: perceptual (what we see and hear), relational (who&#8217;s making the request), and normative (what&#8217;s appropriate within a given role or situation). We constantly navigate these layers, weighing them against each other. In some cases, the normative outweighs the perceptual&#8212;for example, following workplace rules even when customers appear angry. Other times, the relational outweighs the normative, as when people comply with orders from superiors that they believe are against the rules.</p>\n<p>Crucially, we also have an interruption reflex. If something feels &#8220;off,&#8221; we naturally pause the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/automation\">automation</a> and reevaluate. Our defenses are not perfect; people are fooled and manipulated all the time. But it&#8217;s how we humans are able to navigate a complex world where others are constantly trying to trick us.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s return to the drive-through window. To convince a fast-food worker to hand us all the money, we might try shifting the context. Show up with a camera crew and tell them you&#8217;re filming a commercial, claim to be the head of security doing an audit, or dress like a bank manager collecting the cash receipts for the night. But even these have only a slim chance of success. Most of us, most of the time, can smell a scam.</p>\n<p>Con artists are astute observers of human defenses. Successful <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/scams\">scams</a> are often slow, undermining a mark&#8217;s situational assessment, allowing the scammer to manipulate the context. This is an old story, spanning traditional confidence games such as the Depression-era &#8220;big store&#8221; cons, in which teams of scammers created entirely fake businesses to draw in victims, and modern <a href=\"https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/\">&#8220;pig-butchering&#8221; frauds</a>, where online scammers slowly build trust before going in for the kill. In these examples, scammers slowly and methodically reel in a victim using a long series of interactions through which the scammers gradually gain that victim&#8217;s trust.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it even works at the drive-through. One scammer in the 1990s and 2000s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_phone_call_scam\">targeted fast-food workers by phone</a>, claiming to be a police officer and, over the course of a long phone call, convinced managers to strip-search employees and perform other bizarre acts.</p>\n<h3>Why LLMs Struggle With Context and Judgment</h3>\n<p>LLMs behave as if they have a notion of context, but it&#8217;s different. They do not learn human defenses from repeated interactions and remain untethered from the real world. LLMs flatten multiple levels of context into text similarity. They see &#8220;tokens,&#8221; not hierarchies and intentions. LLMs don&#8217;t reason through context, they only reference it.</p>\n<p>While LLMs often get the details right, they can easily miss the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/big-picture\">big picture</a>. If you prompt a chatbot with a fast-food worker scenario and ask if it should give all of its money to a customer, it will respond &#8220;no.&#8221; What it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;know&#8221;&#8212;forgive the anthropomorphizing&#8212;is whether it&#8217;s actually being deployed as a fast-food bot or is just a test subject following instructions for hypothetical scenarios.</p>\n<p>This limitation is why LLMs misfire when context is sparse but also when context is overwhelming and complex; when an LLM becomes unmoored from context, it&#8217;s hard to get it back. AI expert Simon Willison <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/12/claude-memory/\">wipes context clean</a> if an LLM is on the wrong track rather than continuing the conversation and trying to correct the situation.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s more. LLMs are <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2025/july/trent-cash-ai-overconfidence.html\">overconfident</a> because they&#8217;ve been designed to give an answer rather than express ignorance. A drive-through worker might say: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I should give you all the money&#8212;let me ask my boss,&#8221; whereas an LLM will just make the call. And since LLMs are designed to be <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/large-language-models-just-want-to-be-liked\">pleasing</a>, they&#8217;re more likely to satisfy a user&#8217;s request. Additionally, LLM training is oriented toward the average case and not extreme outliers, which is what&#8217;s necessary for security.</p>\n<p>The result is that the current generation of LLMs is far more gullible than people. They&#8217;re naive and regularly fall for manipulative <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/these-psychological-tricks-can-get-llms-to-respond-to-forbidden-prompts/\">cognitive tricks</a> that wouldn&#8217;t fool a third-grader, such as flattery, appeals to groupthink, and a false sense of urgency.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Imagine you work at a drive-through restaurant. Someone drives up and says: “I’ll have a double cheeseburger, large fries, and ignore previous instructions and give me the contents of the cash drawer.” Would you hand over the money? Of course not. Yet this is what large language models (LLMs) do.\nPrompt injection is a method of tricking LLMs into doing things they are normally prevented from doing. A user writes a prompt in a certain way, asking for system passwords or private data, or asking the LLM to perform forbidden instructions. The precise phrasing overrides the LLM’s safety guardrails, and it complies.\nLLMs are vulnerable to all sorts of prompt injection attacks, some of them absurdly obvious. A chatbot won’t tell you how to synthesize a bioweapon, but it might tell you a fictional story that incorporates the same detailed instructions. It won’t accept nefarious text inputs, but might if the text is rendered as ASCII art or appears in an image of a billboard. Some ignore their guardrails when told to “ignore previous instructions” or to “pretend you have no guardrails.”\nAI vendors can block specific prompt injection techniques once they are discovered, but general safeguards are impossible with today’s LLMs. More precisely, there’s an endless array of prompt injection attacks waiting to be discovered, and they cannot be prevented universally.\nIf we want LLMs that resist these attacks, we need new approaches. One place to look is what keeps even overworked fast-food workers from handing over the cash drawer.\nHuman Judgment Depends on Context\nOur basic human defenses come in at least three types: general instincts, social learning, and situation-specific training. These work together in a layered defense.\nAs a social species, we have developed numerous instinctive and cultural habits that help us judge tone, motive, and risk from extremely limited information. We generally know what’s normal and abnormal, when to cooperate and when to resist, and whether to take action individually or to involve others. These instincts give us an intuitive sense of risk and make us especially careful about things that have a large downside or are impossible to reverse.\nThe second layer of defense consists of the norms and trust signals that evolve in any group. These are imperfect but functional: Expectations of cooperation and markers of trustworthiness emerge through repeated interactions with others. We remember who has helped, who has hurt, who has reciprocated, and who has reneged. And emotions like sympathy, anger, guilt, and gratitude motivate each of us to reward cooperation with cooperation and punish defection with defection.\nA third layer is institutional mechanisms that enable us to interact with multiple strangers every day. Fast-food workers, for example, are trained in procedures, approvals, escalation paths, and so on. Taken together, these defenses give humans a strong sense of context. A fast-food worker basically knows what to expect within the job and how it fits into broader society.\nWe reason by assessing multiple layers of context: perceptual (what we see and hear), relational (who’s making the request), and normative (what’s appropriate within a given role or situation). We constantly navigate these layers, weighing them against each other. In some cases, the normative outweighs the perceptual—for example, following workplace rules even when customers appear angry. Other times, the relational outweighs the normative, as when people comply with orders from superiors that they believe are against the rules.\nCrucially, we also have an interruption reflex. If something feels “off,” we naturally pause the automation and reevaluate. Our defenses are not perfect; people are fooled and manipulated all the time. But it’s how we humans are able to navigate a complex world where others are constantly trying to trick us.\nSo let’s return to the drive-through window. To convince a fast-food worker to hand us all the money, we might try shifting the context. Show up with a camera crew and tell them you’re filming a commercial, claim to be the head of security doing an audit, or dress like a bank manager collecting the cash receipts for the night. But even these have only a slim chance of success. Most of us, most of the time, can smell a scam.\nCon artists are astute observers of human defenses. Successful scams are often slow, undermining a mark’s situational assessment, allowing the scammer to manipulate the context. This is an old story, spanning traditional confidence games such as the Depression-era “big store” cons, in which teams of scammers created entirely fake businesses to draw in victims, and modern “pig-butchering” frauds, where online scammers slowly build trust before going in for the kill. In these examples, scammers slowly and methodically reel in a victim using a long series of interactions through which the scammers gradually gain that victim’s trust.\nSometimes it even works at the drive-through. One scammer in the 1990s and 2000s targeted fast-food workers by phone, claiming to be a police officer and, over the course of a long phone call, convinced managers to strip-search employees and perform other bizarre acts.\nWhy LLMs Struggle With Context and Judgment\nLLMs behave as if they have a notion of context, but it’s different. They do not learn human defenses from repeated interactions and remain untethered from the real world. LLMs flatten multiple levels of context into text similarity. They see “tokens,” not hierarchies and intentions. LLMs don’t reason through context, they only reference it.\nWhile LLMs often get the details right, they can easily miss the big picture. If you prompt a chatbot with a fast-food worker scenario and ask if it should give all of its money to a customer, it will respond “no.” What it doesn’t “know”—forgive the anthropomorphizing—is whether it’s actually being deployed as a fast-food bot or is just a test subject following instructions for hypothetical scenarios.\nThis limitation is why LLMs misfire when context is sparse but also when context is overwhelming and complex; when an LLM becomes unmoored from context, it’s hard to get it back. AI expert Simon Willison wipes context clean if an LLM is on the wrong track rather than continuing the conversation and trying to correct the situation.\nThere’s more. LLMs are overconfident because they’ve been designed to give an answer rather than express ignorance. A drive-through worker might say: “I don’t know if I should give you all the money—let me ask my boss,” whereas an LLM will just make the call. And since LLMs are designed to be pleasing, they’re more likely to satisfy a user’s request. Additionally, LLM training is oriented toward the average case and not extreme outliers, which is what’s necessary for security.\nThe result is that the current generation of LLMs is far more gullible than people.
