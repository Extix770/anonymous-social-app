He had thrown his support behind the pro-democracy protesters in 1989. As a result, he had to flee to France, with an arrest warrant hanging over his head. He was never able to return home.

He was usually the one to invite officials to dine, so as to curry favor with the show of hospitality. Over the meal, the officials told Wan that the Ministry of State Security was going to send agents to work undercover at his company in positions dealing with international relations. The officials cast the move to embed these minders as an act of protection for Wan and the company&#8217;s other executives, a security measure that would keep them from stumbling into unseen risks in their dealings with foreigners. &#8220;You have a lot of international business, which raises security issues for you. There are situations that you don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Wan recalled the officials telling him. &#8220;They said, &#8216;We are sending some people over. You can just treat them like regular employees.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wan said he knew that around this time, state intelligence also contacted other tech companies in Beijing with the same request. He couldn&#8217;t say what the situation was for Huawei, which was still a little startup far to the south in Shenzhen, not yet on anyone&#8217;s radar. But Wan said he didn&#8217;t believe that Huawei would have been able to escape similar demands. &#8220;That is a certainty,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Telecommunications is an industry that has to do with keeping control of a nation&#8217;s lifeline&#8230;and actually in any system of communications, there&#8217;s a back-end platform that could be used for eavesdropping.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was a rare moment of an executive lifting the cone of silence surrounding the MSS&#8217;s relationship with China&#8217;s high-tech industry. It was rare, in fact, in any country. Around the world, such spying operations rank among governments&#8217; closest-held secrets. When Edward Snowden had exposed the NSA&#8217;s operations abroad, he&#8217;d ended up in exile in Russia. Wan, too, might have risked arrest had he still been living in China.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here are two <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/telecom/house-of-huawei-review-the-path-to-dominance-ca3bb438\">book</a> <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/house-huawei-secret-history-chinas-most-powerful-company\">reviews</a>.</p>\n",

Over the meal, the officials told Wan that the Ministry of State Security was going to send agents to work undercover at his company in positions dealing with international relations. The officials cast the move to embed these minders as an act of protection for Wan and the company’s other executives, a security measure that would keep them from stumbling into unseen risks in their dealings with foreigners. “You have a lot of international business, which raises security issues for you. There are situations that you don’t understand,” Wan recalled the officials telling him. “They said, ‘We are sending some people over. You can just treat them like regular employees.'”\nWan said he knew that around this time, state intelligence also contacted other tech companies in Beijing with the same request. He couldn’t say what the situation was for Huawei, which was still a little startup far to the south in Shenzhen, not yet on anyone’s radar. But Wan said he didn’t believe that Huawei would have been able to escape similar demands. “That is a certainty,” he said.\n“Telecommunications is an industry that has to do with keeping control of a nation’s lifeline…and actually in any system of communications, there’s a back-end platform that could be used for eavesdropping.”\nIt was a rare moment of an executive lifting the cone of silence surrounding the MSS’s relationship with China’s high-tech industry. It was rare, in fact, in any country. Around the world, such spying operations rank among governments’ closest-held secrets. When Edward Snowden had exposed the NSA’s operations abroad, he’d ended up in exile in Russia. Wan, too, might have risked arrest had he still been living in China.\n\nHere are two book reviews.",
