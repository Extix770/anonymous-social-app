The answer &#8211; recasting the business as an AI company &#8211; is just the latest chapter in a story of many rebrands that link the operation to Russia&#8217;s largest private university.</p>\n<p>Search in Google for any terms related to academic cheating services &#8212; e.g., &#8220;help with exam online&#8221; or &#8220;term paper online&#8221; &#8212; and you&#8217;re likely to encounter websites with the words &#8220;nerd&#8221; or &#8220;geek&#8221; in them, such as <strong>thenerdify[.]com</strong> and <strong>geekly-hub[.]com</strong>. With a simple request sent via text message, you can hire their tutors to help with any assignment.</p>\n<p>These nerdy and geeky-branded websites frequently cite their &#8220;honor code,&#8221; which emphasizes they do not condone academic cheating, will not write your term papers for you, and will only offer support and advice for customers. But according to <a href=\"https://thisisntfine.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Isn&#8217;t Fine</a>, a Substack blog about contract cheating and essay mills, the Nerdify brand of websites will happily ignore that mantra.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We tested the quick SMS for a price quote,&#8221; wrote This Isn&#8217;t Fine author <strong>Joseph Thibault</strong>. &#8220;The honor code references and platitudes apparently stop at the website.

According to <a href=\"https://essayscam.org/forum/wc/interview-former-freelancer-working-livingston-6444/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a lengthy account from a former employee</a>, Livingston Research mainly farmed its writing tasks out to low-cost workers from Kenya, Philippines, Pakistan, Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Pokatilo moved from Ukraine to the United Kingdom in Sept. 2015 and co-founded a company called <strong>Awesome Technologies</strong>, which pitched itself as a way for people to outsource tasks by sending a text message to the service&#8217;s assistants.</p>\n<p>The other co-founder of Awesome Technologies is 36-year-old <strong>Filip Perkon</strong>, a Swedish man living in London who touts himself as a serial entrepreneur and investor. Years before starting Awesome together, Perkon and Pokatilo co-founded a student group called <strong>Russian Business Week</strong> while the two were classmates at the London School of Economics.

Online reviews from students paint a picture of unkept promises: Prospective students from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and other nations paying thousands in advance fees for promised study visas to Russia, only to have their applications denied with no refunds offered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My experience with Synergy University has been nothing short of heartbreaking,&#8221; reads one such account. &#8220;When I first discovered the school, their representative was extremely responsive and eager to assist. He communicated frequently and made me believe I was in safe hands. However, after paying my hard-earned tuition fees, my visa was denied. It’s been over 9 months since that denial, and despite their promises, I have received no refund whatsoever. My messages are now ignored, and the same representative who once replied instantly no longer responds at all. Synergy University, how can an institution in Europe feel comfortable exploiting the hopes of Africans who trust you with their life savings? This is not just unethical — it’s predatory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This pattern repeats across reviews by multilingual students from Pakistan, Nepal, India, and various African nations &#8212; all describing the same scheme: Attractive online marketing, promises of easy visa approval, upfront payment requirements, and then silence after visa denials.</p>\n<p>Reddit discussions in r/Moscow and r/AskARussian are filled with warnings. &#8220;It&#8217;s a scam, a diploma mill,&#8221; writes one user. &#8220;They literally sell exams. There was an investigation on Rossiya-1 television showing students paying to pass tests.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Nerdify website&#8217;s &#8220;About Us&#8221; page says the company was co-founded by Pokatilo and an American named <strong>Brian Mellor</strong>. The latter identity seems to have been fabricated, or at least there is no evidence that a person with this name ever worked at Nerdify.</p>\n<p>Rather, it appears that the SMS assistance company co-founded by Messrs. Pokatilo and Perkon (Awesome Technologies) fizzled out shortly after its creation, and that Nerdify soon adopted the process of accepting assignment requests via text message and routing them to freelance writers.</p>\n<p>A closer look at an early &#8220;About Us&#8221; page for Nerdify in The Wayback Machine suggests that Mr. Perkon was the real co-founder of the company: The photo at the top of the page shows four people wearing Nerdify T-shirts seated around a table on a rooftop deck in San Francisco, and the man facing the camera is Perkon.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72799\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72799\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72799\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify.png 1628w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-768x407.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-1536x813.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-782x414.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/perkon-nerdify-267x140.png 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72799\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Filip Perkon, top right, is pictured wearing a Nerdify T-shirt in an archived copy of the company&#8217;s About Us page.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "A sprawling academic cheating network turbocharged by Google Ads that has generated nearly $25 million in revenue has curious ties to a Kremlin-connected oligarch whose Russian university builds drones for Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nThe Nerdify homepage.\n\nThe link between essay mills and Russian attack drones might seem improbable, but understanding it begins with a simple question: How does a human-intensive academic cheating service stay relevant in an era when students can simply ask AI to write their term papers? The answer – recasting the business as an AI company – is just the latest chapter in a story of many rebrands that link the operation to Russia’s largest private university.\nSearch in Google for any terms related to academic cheating services — e.g., “help with exam online” or “term paper online” — and you’re likely to encounter websites with the words “nerd” or “geek” in them, such as thenerdify[.]com and geekly-hub[.]com. With a simple request sent via text message, you can hire their tutors to help with any assignment.\nThese nerdy and geeky-branded websites frequently cite their “honor code,” which emphasizes they do not condone academic cheating, will not write your term papers for you, and will only offer support and advice for customers. But according to This Isn’t Fine, a Substack blog about contract cheating and essay mills, the Nerdify brand of websites will happily ignore that mantra.\n“We tested the quick SMS for a price quote,” wrote This Isn’t Fine author Joseph Thibault. “The honor code references and platitudes apparently stop at the website. Within three minutes, we confirmed that a full three-page, plagiarism- and AI-free MLA formatted Argumentative essay could be ours for the low price of $141.”\n\nA screenshot from Joseph Thibault’s Substack post shows him purchasing a 3-page paper with the Nerdify service.\n\nGoogle prohibits ads that “enable dishonest behavior.” Yet, a sprawling global essay and homework cheating network run under the Nerdy brands has quietly bought its way to the top of Google searches – booking revenues of almost $25 million through a maze of companies in Cyprus, Malta and Hong Kong, while pitching “tutoring” that delivers finished work that students can turn in.\nWhen one Nerdy-related Google Ads account got shut down, the group behind the company would form a new entity with a front-person (typically a young Ukrainian woman), start a new ads account along with a new website and domain name (usually with “nerdy” in the brand), and resume running Google ads for the same set of keywords.\nUK companies belonging to the group that have been shut down by Google Ads since Jan 2025 include:\n–Proglobal Solutions LTD (advertised nerdifyit[.]com);\nAW Tech Limited (advertised thenerdify[.]com);\nGeekly Solutions Ltd (advertised geekly-hub[.]com).\nCurrently active Google Ads accounts for the Nerdify brands include:\n-OK Marketing LTD (advertising geekly-hub[.]net⁩), formed in the name of Olha Karpenko, a young Ukrainian woman;\nTwo Sigma Solutions LTD (advertising litero[.]ai), formed in the name of Olekszij (Alexey) Pokatilo.\n\nGoogle’s Ads Transparency page for current Nerdify advertiser OK Marketing LTD.\n\nMr. Pokatilo has been in the essay-writing business since at least 2009, operating a paper-mill enterprise called Livingston Research alongside Alexander Korsukov, who is listed as an owner. According to a lengthy account from a former employee, Livingston Research mainly farmed its writing tasks out to low-cost workers from Kenya, Philippines, Pakistan, Russia and Ukraine.\nPokatilo moved from Ukraine to the United Kingdom in Sept. 2015 and co-founded a company called Awesome Technologies, which pitched itself as a way for people to outsource tasks by sending a text message to the service’s assistants.\nThe other co-founder of Awesome Technologies is 36-year-old Filip Perkon, a Swedish man living in London who touts himself as a serial entrepreneur and investor. Years before starting Awesome together, Perkon and Pokatilo co-founded a student group called Russian Business Week while the two were classmates at the London School of Economics. According to the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev, Perkon’s birth certificate was issued by the Soviet Embassy in Sweden.\n\nAlexey Pokatilo (left) and Filip Perkon at a Facebook event for startups in San Francisco in mid-2015.\n\nAround the time Perkon and Pokatilo launched Awesome Technologies, Perkon was building a social media propaganda tool called the Russian Diplomatic Online Club, which Perkon said would “turbo-charge” Russian messaging online. The club’s newsletter urged subscribers to install in their Twitter accounts a third-party app called Tweetsquad that would retweet Kremlin messaging on the social media platform.\nPerkon was praised by the Russian Embassy in London for his efforts: During the contentious Brexit vote that ultimately led to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Russian embassy in London used this spam tweeting tool to auto-retweet the Russian ambassador’s posts from supporters’ accounts.\nNeither Mr. Perkon nor Mr. Pokatilo replied to requests for comment.\nA review of corporations tied to Mr. Perkon as indexed by the business research service North Data finds he holds or held director positions in several U.K. subsidiaries of Synergy, Russia’s largest private education provider. Synergy has more than 35,000 students, and sells T-shirts with patriotic slogans such as “Crimea is Ours,” and “The Russian Empire — Reloaded.”\nThe president of Synergy is Vadim Lobov, a Kremlin insider whose headquarters on the outskirts of Moscow reportedly features a wall-sized portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the pop-art style of Andy Warhol. For a number of years, Lobov and Perkon co-produced a cross-cultural event in the U.K. called Russian Film Week.\n\nSynergy President Vadim Lobov and Filip Perkon, speaking at a press conference for Russian Film Week, a cross-cultural event in the U.K. co-produced by both men.\n\nMr. Lobov was one of 11 individuals reportedly hand-picked by the convicted Russian spy Marina Butina to attend the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast held in Washington D.C. just two weeks after President Trump’s first inauguration.\nWhile Synergy University promotes itself as Russia’s largest private educational institution, hundreds of international students tell a different story. Online reviews from students paint a picture of unkept promises: Prospective students from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and other nations paying thousands in advance fees for promised study visas to Russia, only to have their applications denied with no refunds offered.\n“My experience with Synergy University has been nothing short of heartbreaking,” reads one such account. “When I first discovered the school, their representative was extremely responsive and eager to assist. He communicated frequently and made me believe I was in safe hands. However, after paying my hard-earned tuition fees, my visa was denied. It’s been over 9 months since that denial, and despite their promises, I have received no refund whatsoever. My messages are now ignored, and the same representative who once replied instantly no longer responds at all. Synergy University, how can an institution in Europe feel comfortable exploiting the hopes of Africans who trust you with their life savings? This is not just unethical — it’s predatory.”\nThis pattern repeats across reviews by multilingual students from Pakistan, Nepal, India, and various African nations — all describing the same scheme: Attractive online marketing, promises of easy visa approval, upfront payment requirements, and then silence after visa denials.\nReddit discussions in r/Moscow and r/AskARussian are filled with warnings. “It’s a scam, a diploma mill,” writes one user. “They literally sell exams. There was an investigation on Rossiya-1 television showing students paying to pass tests.”\nThe Nerdify website’s “About Us” page says the company was co-founded by Pokatilo and an American named Brian Mellor. The latter identity seems to have been fabricated, or at least there is no evidence that a person with this name ever worked at Nerdify.\nRather, it appears that the SMS assistance company co-founded by Messrs. Pokatilo and Perkon (Awesome Technologies) fizzled out shortly after its creation, and that Nerdify soon adopted the process of accepting assignment requests via text message and routing them to freelance writers.\nA closer look at an early “About Us” page for Nerdify in The Wayback Machine suggests that Mr. Perkon was the real co-founder of the company: The photo at the top of the page shows four people wearing Nerdify T-shirts seated around a table on a rooftop deck in San Francisco, and the man facing the camera is Perkon.\n\nFilip Perkon, top right, is pictured wearing a Nerdify T-shirt in an archived copy of the company’s About Us page. Image: archive.org.\n\nWhere are they now? Pokatilo is currently running a startup called Litero.Ai, which appears to be an AI-based essay writing service. In July 2025, Mr. Pokatilo received pre-seed funding of $800,000 for Litero from an investment program backed by the venture capital firms AltaIR Capital, Yellow Rocks, Smart Partnership Capital, and I2BF Global Ventures.\nMeanwhile, Filip Perkon is busy setting up toy rubber duck stores in Miami and in at least three locations in the United Kingdom. These “Duck World” shops market themselves as “the world’s largest duck store.”\nThis past week, Mr. Lobov was in India with Putin’s entourage on a charm tour with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although Synergy is billed as an educational institution, a review of the company’s sprawling corporate footprint (via DNS) shows it also is assisting the Russian government in its war against Ukraine.\n\nSynergy University President Vadim Lobov (right) pictured this week in India next to Natalia Popova, a Russian TV presenter known for her close ties to Putin’s family, particularly Putin’s daughter, who works with Popova at the education and culture-focused Innopraktika Foundation.\n\nThe website bpla.synergy[.]bot, for instance, says the company is involved in developing combat drones to aid Russian forces and to evade international sanctions on the supply and re-export of high-tech products.\n\nA screenshot from the website of synergy,bot shows the company is actively engaged in building armed drones for the war in Ukraine.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity would like to thank the anonymous researcher NatInfoSec for their assistance in this investigation.\nUpdate, Dec. 8, 10:06 a.m. ET: Mr. Pokatilo responded to requests for comment after the publication of this story. Pokatilo said he has no relation to Synergy nor to Mr. Lobov, and that his work with Mr. Perkon ended with the dissolution of Awesome Technologies.\n“I have had no involvement in any of his projects and business activities mentioned in the article and he has no involvement in Litero.ai,” Pokatilo said of Perkon.\nMr. Pokatilo said his new company Litero “does not provide contract cheating services and is built specifically to improve transparency and academic integrity in the age of universal use of AI by students.”\n“I am Ukrainian,” he said in an email. “My close friends, colleagues, and some family members continue to live in Ukraine under the ongoing invasion.
