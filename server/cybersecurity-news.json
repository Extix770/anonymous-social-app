Intel 471 says Rey previously used the handle &#8220;<strong>Hikki-Chan</strong>&#8221; on BreachForums, where their first post shared data allegedly stolen from the <strong>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</strong> (CDC).</p>\n<p>In that February 2024 post about the CDC, Hikki-Chan says they could be reached at the Telegram username <strong>@wristmug</strong>. In May 2024, @wristmug posted in a Telegram group chat called &#8220;Pantifan&#8221; a copy of an extortion email they said they received that included their email address and password.</p>\n<p>The message that @wristmug cut and pasted appears to have been part of an <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">automated email scam</a> that claims it was sent by a hacker who has compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. These missives threaten to release the video to all your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom, and they typically reference a real password the recipient has used previously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Noooooo,&#8221; the @wristmug account wrote in mock horror after posting a screenshot of the scam message. &#8220;I must be done guys.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72731\" style=\"width: 533px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72731\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72731\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mustbedone.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"523\" height=\"800\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A message posted to Telegram by Rey/@wristmug.</p></div>\n<p>In posting their screenshot, @wristmug redacted the username portion of the email address referenced in the body of the scam message.

Rey claimed in 2024 to be 15 years old, and to have family connections to Ireland.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Rey mentioned in several Telegram chats that he had Irish heritage, even posting a graphic that shows the prevalence of the surname &#8220;<strong>Ginty</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72732\" style=\"width: 689px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72732\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72732\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/imaginty.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"679\" height=\"370\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72732\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rey, on Telegram claiming to have association to the surname &#8220;Ginty.&#8221; Image: Flashpoint.</p></div>\n<p>Spycloud indexed hundreds of credentials stolen from cybero5dev@proton.me, and those details indicate that Rey&#8217;s computer is a shared Microsoft Windows device located in Amman, Jordan.

The infostealer data also shows Zaid Khader frequently accessed internal websites for employees of <strong>Royal Jordanian Airlines</strong>.</p>\n<h2>MEET SAIF</h2>\n<p>The infostealer data makes clear that Rey&#8217;s full name is <strong>Saif Al-Din Khader</strong>. Having no luck contacting Saif directly, KrebsOnSecurity sent an email to his father Zaid. The message invited the father to respond via email, phone or Signal, explaining that his son appeared to be deeply enmeshed in a serious cybercrime conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Less than two hours later, I received a Signal message from Saif, who said his dad suspected the email was a scam and had forwarded it to him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I saw your email, unfortunately I don&#8217;t think my dad would respond to this because they think its some &#8216;scam email,'&#8221; said Saif, who told me he turns 16 years old next month. &#8220;So I decided to talk to you directly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Saif explained that he&#8217;d already heard from European law enforcement officials, and had been trying to extricate himself from SLSH. When asked why then he was involved in releasing SLSH&#8217;s new ShinySp1d3r ransomware-as-a-service offering, Saif said he couldn&#8217;t just suddenly quit the group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well I cant just dip like that, I&#8217;m trying to clean up everything I&#8217;m associated with and move on,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72752\" style=\"width: 722px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72752\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72752\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hellcat.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"712\" height=\"693\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72752\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The former Hellcat ransomware site.

I have told them nearly everything. I haven&#8217;t really done anything like breaching into a corp or extortion related since September.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Saif suggested that a story about him right now could endanger any further cooperation he may be able to provide. He also said he wasn&#8217;t sure if the U.S. or European authorities had been in contact with the Jordanian government about his involvement with the hacking group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A story would bring so much unwanted heat and would make things very difficult if I&#8217;m going to cooperate,&#8221; Saif said. &#8220;I&#8217;m unsure whats going to happen they said they&#8217;re in contact with multiple countries regarding my request but its been like an entire week and I got no updates from them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Saif shared a screenshot that indicated he&#8217;d contacted Europol authorities late last month. But he couldn&#8217;t name any law enforcement officials he said were responding to his inquiries, and KrebsOnSecurity was unable to verify his claims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really care I just want to move on from all this stuff even if its going to be prison time or whatever they gonna say,&#8221; Saif said.</p>\n",

The screenshot below, for example, shows that 05tdev was part of a group called Cyb3r Drag0nz Team.\n\nRey/o5tdev’s defacement pages. Image: archive.org.\n\nA 2023 report from SentinelOne described Cyb3r Drag0nz Team as a hacktivist group with a history of launching DDoS attacks and cyber defacements as well as engaging in data leak activity.\n“Cyb3r Drag0nz Team claims to have leaked data on over a million of Israeli citizens spread across multiple leaks,” SentinelOne reported. “To date, the group has released multiple .RAR archives of purported personal information on citizens across Israel.”\nThe cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint finds the Telegram user @05tdev was active in 2023 and early 2024, posting in Arabic on anti-Israel channels like “Ghost of Palestine” [full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this blog].\n‘I’M A GINTY’\nFlashpoint shows that Rey’s Telegram account (ID7047194296) was particularly active in a cybercrime-focused channel called Jacuzzi, where this user shared several personal details, including that their father was an airline pilot. Rey claimed in 2024 to be 15 years old, and to have family connections to Ireland.\nSpecifically, Rey mentioned in several Telegram chats that he had Irish heritage, even posting a graphic that shows the prevalence of the surname “Ginty.”\n\nRey, on Telegram claiming to have association to the surname “Ginty.” Image: Flashpoint.\n\nSpycloud indexed hundreds of credentials stolen from cybero5dev@proton.me, and those details indicate that Rey’s computer is a shared Microsoft Windows device located in Amman, Jordan. The credential data stolen from Rey in early 2024 show there are multiple users of the infected PC, but that all shared the same last name of Khader and an address in Amman, Jordan.\nThe “autofill” data lifted from Rey’s family PC contains an entry for a 46-year-old Zaid Khader that says his mother’s maiden name was Ginty. The infostealer data also shows Zaid Khader frequently accessed internal websites for employees of Royal Jordanian Airlines.\nMEET SAIF\nThe infostealer data makes clear that Rey’s full name is Saif Al-Din Khader. Having no luck contacting Saif directly, KrebsOnSecurity sent an email to his father Zaid. The message invited the father to respond via email, phone or Signal, explaining that his son appeared to be deeply enmeshed in a serious cybercrime conspiracy.\nLess than two hours later, I received a Signal message from Saif, who said his dad suspected the email was a scam and had forwarded it to him.\n“I saw your email, unfortunately I don’t think my dad would respond to this because they think its some ‘scam email,'” said Saif, who told me he turns 16 years old next month. “So I decided to talk to you directly.”\nSaif explained that he’d already heard from European law enforcement officials, and had been trying to extricate himself from SLSH. When asked why then he was involved in releasing SLSH’s new ShinySp1d3r ransomware-as-a-service offering, Saif said he couldn’t just suddenly quit the group.\n“Well I cant just dip like that, I’m trying to clean up everything I’m associated with and move on,” he said.\n\nThe former Hellcat ransomware site. Image: Kelacyber.com\n\nHe also shared that ShinySp1d3r is just a rehash of Hellcat ransomware, except modified with AI tools. “I gave the source code of Hellcat ransomware out basically.”\nSaif claims he reached out on his own recently to the Telegram account for Operation Endgame, the codename for an ongoing law enforcement operation targeting cybercrime services, vendors and their customers.\n“I’m already cooperating with law enforcement,” Saif said. “In fact, I have been talking to them since at least June. I have told them nearly everything. I haven’t really done anything like breaching into a corp or extortion related since September.”\nSaif suggested that a story about him right now could endanger any further cooperation he may be able to provide. He also said he wasn’t sure if the U.S. or European authorities had been in contact with the Jordanian government about his involvement with the hacking group.\n“A story would bring so much unwanted heat and would make things very difficult if I’m going to cooperate,” Saif said. “I’m unsure whats going to happen they said they’re in contact with multiple countries regarding my request but its been like an entire week and I got no updates from them.”\nSaif shared a screenshot that indicated he’d contacted Europol authorities late last month. But he couldn’t name any law enforcement officials he said were responding to his inquiries, and KrebsOnSecurity was unable to verify his claims.\n“I don’t really care I just want to move on from all this stuff even if its going to be prison time or whatever they gonna say,” Saif said.",

Judging from the audience reaction at the recent <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/world-forum-democracy\">World Forum on Democracy</a> in Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities.</p>\n<p>We have just published the book <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/\">Rewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship</a><em>.</em> In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better.</p>\n<p>Here are four such stories unfolding right now around the world, showing how AI is being used by some to make democracy better, stronger, and more responsive to people.</p>\n<h3>Japan</h3>\n<p>Last year, then 33-year-old engineer Takahiro Anno was a fringe candidate for governor of Tokyo. Running as an independent candidate, he ended up coming in fifth in a crowded <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/world/asia/tokyo-governors-election.html\">field of 56</a>, largely thanks to the unprecedented use of an authorized AI avatar. That avatar answered <a href=\"https://futurepolis.substack.com/p/meet-your-ai-politician-of-the-future\">8,600 questions from voters</a> on a 17-day continuous YouTube livestream and garnered the attention of campaign innovators worldwide.</p>\n<p>Two months ago, Anno-san was <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20250722/p2a/00m/0na/016000c\">elected</a> to Japan&#8217;s upper legislative chamber, again leveraging the power of AI to engage constituents&#8212;this time answering <a href=\"https://note-com.translate.goog/annotakahiro24/n/n4ec669d391dd?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc&amp;_x_tr_hist=true\">more than 20,000 questions</a>. His new party, Team Mirai, is also an AI-enabled civic technology shop, producing software aimed at making governance better and more participatory. The party is leveraging its share of Japan&#8217;s public funding for political parties to build the <a href=\"https://note.com/team_mirai_jp/n/nd1656aa5f86d\">Mirai Assembly</a> app, enabling constituents to express opinions on and ask questions about bills in the legislature, and to organize those expressions using AI. The party promises that its members will <a href=\"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/291183/team-mirai-in-spotlight-with-aim-to-update-democracy-with-tech\">direct their questioning</a> in committee hearings based on public input.</p>\n<h3>Brazil</h3>\n<p>Brazil is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/11/05/359830235/brazil-the-land-of-many-lawyers-and-very-slow-justice\">notoriously litigious</a>, with even more lawyers per capita than the US. The courts are chronically overwhelmed with cases and the resultant backlog costs the government billions to process. Estimates are that the Brazilian federal government spends about 1.6% of GDP per year <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/business/2024/01/brazil-leads-spending-on-courts-among-53-countries.shtml\">operating the courts</a> and another 2.5% to 3% of GDP issuing <a href=\"https://valorinternational.globo.com/economy/news/2025/04/11/federal-court-losses-already-consume-25percent-of-gdp-annually.ghtml\">court-ordered payments</a> from lawsuits the government has lost.</p>\n<p>Since at least 2019, the Brazilian government has <a href=\"https://www.techandjustice.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/brazil\">aggressively adopted</a> AI to automate procedures throughout its judiciary. AI is not making judicial decisions, but aiding in distributing caseloads, performing legal research, transcribing hearings, identifying duplicative filings, preparing initial orders for signature and clustering similar cases for joint consideration: all things to make the judiciary system work more efficiently. And the results are significant; Brazil&#8217;s federal supreme court backlog, for example, dropped in 2025 to its <a href=\"https://noticias-stf-wp-prd.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/wpallimport/uploads/2025/07/01191513/PRESTACAO-JURISDICIONAL-2025-4.pdf\">lowest levels in 33 years</a>.</p>\n<p>While it seems clear that the courts are realizing efficiency benefits from leveraging AI, there is a postscript to the courts&#8217; AI implementation project over the past five-plus years: the litigators are using these tools, too. Lawyers are using AI assistance to file cases in Brazilian courts at an <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2025/latin-america-judges-ai-crimes/\">unprecedented rate</a>, with new cases growing by nearly 40% in volume over the past five years.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing for Brazilian litigators to regain the upper hand in this arms race. It has been argued that litigation, particularly against the government, is a vital form of <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/30245797\">civic participation</a>, essential to the <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1147&amp;context=elj\">self-governance function</a> of democracy. Other democracies&#8217; court systems should study and learn from Brazil&#8217;s experience and seek to use technology to maximize the bandwidth and liquidity of the courts to process litigation.</p>\n<h3>Germany</h3>\n<p>Now, we move to Europe and innovations in informing voters. Since 2002, the German Federal Agency for Civic Education has operated a non-partisan voting guide called <a href=\"https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/bundestagswahl2025/app/main_app.html\">Wahl-o-Mat</a>. Officials convene an editorial team of 24 young voters (under 26 and selected for diversity) with experts from science and education to develop a slate of 80 questions. The questions are put to all registered German political parties. The responses are narrowed down to 38 key topics and then published online in a quiz format that voters can use to identify the party whose platform they most identify with.</p>\n<p>In the past two years, outside groups have been innovating alternatives to the official Wahl-o-Mat guide that leverage AI. First came <a href=\"https://www.heise.de/en/news/Electorally-How-artificial-intelligence-should-help-with-voting-decisions-9824511.html\">Wahlweise</a>, a product of the German AI company AIUI. Second, students at the Technical University of Munich deployed an interactive AI system called <a href=\"https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/news/article/wahlchat/\">Wahl.chat</a>. This tool was used by more than <a href=\"https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/technology-for-democracy\">150,000 people</a> within the first four months. In both cases, instead of having to read static webpages about the positions of various political parties, citizens can engage in an interactive conversation with an AI system to more easily get the same information contextualized to their individual interests and questions.</p>\n<p>However, German researchers studying the reliability of such AI tools ahead of the 2025 German federal election raised significant <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15568\">concerns</a> about bias and &#8220;hallucinations&#8221;&#8212;AI tools making up false information. Acknowledging the potential of the technology to increase voter informedness and party transparency, the researchers recommended adopting scientific evaluations comparable to those used in the Agency for Civic Education&#8217;s official tool to improve and institutionalize the technology.</p>\n<h3>United States</h3>\n<p>Finally, the US&#8212;in particular, California, home to <a href=\"https://calmatters.org\">CalMatters</a>, a non-profit, nonpartisan news organization. Since 2023, its <a href=\"https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org\">Digital Democracy</a> project has been collecting every public utterance of California elected officials&#8212;every floor speech, comment made in committee and social media post, along with their voting records, legislation, and campaign contributions&#8212;and making all that information available in a free online platform.</p>\n<p>CalMatters this year launched a new feature that takes this kind of civic watchdog function a big step further. Its <a href=\"https://dicktofel.substack.com/p/bringing-digital-democracy-to-california\">AI Tip Sheets</a> feature uses AI to search through all of this data, looking for anomalies, such as a change in voting position tied to a large campaign contribution. These anomalies appear on a webpage that journalists can access to give them story ideas and a source of data and analysis to drive further reporting.</p>\n<p>This is not AI replacing human journalists; it is a civic watchdog organization using technology to feed evidence-based insights to human reporters. And it&#8217;s no coincidence that this innovation arose from a new kind of media institution&#8212;a non-profit news agency. As the watchdog function of the fourth estate continues to be degraded by the decline of newspapers&#8217; business models, this kind of technological support is a valuable contribution to help a reduced number of human journalists retain something of the scope of action and impact our democracy relies on them for.</p>\n<p>These are just four of many stories from around the globe of AI helping to make democracy stronger. The common thread is that the technology is distributing rather than concentrating power. In all four cases, it is being used to assist people performing their democratic tasks&#8212;politics in Japan, litigation in Brazil, voting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> and watchdog journalism in California&#8212;rather than replacing them.</p>\n<p>In none of these cases is the AI doing something that humans can&#8217;t perfectly competently do. But in all of these cases, we don&#8217;t have enough available humans to do the jobs on their own. A sufficiently trustworthy AI can fill in gaps: amplify the power of civil servants and citizens, improve efficiency, and facilitate engagement between government and the public.</p>\n<p>One of the barriers towards realizing this vision more broadly is the AI market itself. The core technologies are largely being created and marketed by US tech giants. We don&#8217;t know the details of their development: on what material they were trained, what guardrails are designed to shape their behavior, what biases and values are encoded into their systems. And, even worse, we don&#8217;t get a say in the choices associated with those details or how they should change over time. In many cases, it&#8217;s an unacceptable risk to use these for-profit, proprietary AI systems in democratic contexts.</p>\n<p>To address that, we have long <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2023/04/ai-public-option.html\">advocated</a> for the development of &#8220;public AI&#8221;: models and AI systems that are developed under democratic control and deployed for public benefit, not sold by corporations to benefit their shareholders. The movement for this is growing worldwide.</p>\n<p>Switzerland has recently released the world&#8217;s most powerful and fully realized public AI model. It&#8217;s called <a href=\"https://www.swiss-ai.org/apertus\">Apertus</a>, and it was developed jointly by the Swiss government and the university ETH Zurich. The government has made it entirely open source&#8212;open data, open code, open weights&#8212;and free for anyone to use. No illegally acquired copyrighted works were used in its training. It doesn&#8217;t exploit poorly paid human laborers from the global south. Its <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/swiss-ai/Apertus-70B-2509\">performance</a> is about where the large corporate giants were a year ago, which is more than good enough for many applications. And it demonstrates that it&#8217;s not necessary to spend <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/11/07/why-sam-altman-wont-be-on-the-hook-for-openais-massive-spending-spree/\">trillions</a> of dollars creating these models. Apertus takes a huge step forward to realizing the vision of an alternative to big tech&#8212;controlled corporate AI.</p>\n<p>AI technology is not without its costs and risks, and we are not here to minimize them. But the technology has significant benefits as well.</p>\n<p>AI is inherently power-enhancing, and it can magnify what the humans behind it want to do. It can enhance authoritarianism as easily as it can enhance democracy. It&#8217;s up to us to steer the technology in that better direction. If more citizen watchdogs and litigators use AI to amplify their power to oversee government and hold it accountable, if more political parties and election administrators use it to engage meaningfully with and inform voters and if more governments provide democratic alternatives to big tech&#8217;s AI offerings, society will be better off.</p>\n<p><em>This essay was written with Nathan E.

But that is not why people are shelling out $400 for these machines. The only way to watch those 2,200+ channels for free with a Superbox is to install several apps made for the device that enable them to stream this content.</p>\n<p>Superbox&#8217;s homepage includes a prominent message stating the company does &#8220;not sell access to or preinstall any apps that bypass paywalls or provide access to unauthorized content.&#8221; The company explains that they merely provide the hardware, while customers choose which apps to install.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We only sell the hardware device,&#8221; the notice states. &#8220;Customers must use official apps and licensed services; unauthorized use may violate copyright law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Superbox is technically correct here, except for maybe the part about how customers must use official apps and licensed services: Before the Superbox can stream those thousands of channels, users must configure the device to update itself, and the first step involves ripping out Google&#8217;s official Play store and replacing it with something called the &#8220;App Store&#8221; or &#8220;Blue TV Store.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Superbox does this because the device does not use the official Google-certified Android TV system, and its apps will not load otherwise. Only after the Google Play store has been supplanted by this unofficial App Store do the various movie and video streaming apps that are built specifically for the Superbox appear available for download (again, outside of Google&#8217;s app ecosystem).</p>\n<p>Experts say while these Android streaming boxes generally do what they advertise &#8212; enabling buyers to stream video content that would normally require a paid subscription &#8212; the apps that enable the streaming also ensnare the user&#8217;s Internet connection in a distributed residential proxy network that uses the devices to relay traffic from others.</p>\n<p><strong>Ashley</strong> is a senior solutions engineer at <strong>Censys</strong>, a cyber intelligence company that indexes Internet-connected devices, services and hosts. Ashley requested that only her first name be used in this story.</p>\n<p>In a recent video interview, Ashley showed off several Superbox models that Censys was studying in the malware lab &#8212; including one purchased off the shelf at BestBuy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure a lot of people are thinking, &#8216;Hey, how bad could it be if it&#8217;s for sale at the big box stores?'&#8221; she said. &#8220;But the more I looked, things got weirder and weirder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ashley said she found the Superbox devices immediately contacted a server at the Chinese instant messaging service <strong>Tencent</strong> <strong>QQ</strong>, as well as a residential proxy service called <strong>Grass IO</strong>.</p>\n<h2>GET GRASSED</h2>\n<p>Also known as getgrass[.]io, Grass says it is &#8220;a decentralized network that allows users to earn rewards by sharing their unused Internet bandwidth with AI labs and other companies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Buyers seek unused internet bandwidth to access a more diverse range of IP addresses, which enables them to see certain websites from a retail perspective,&#8221; the Grass website explains. &#8220;By utilizing your unused internet bandwidth, they can conduct market research, or perform tasks like web scraping to train AI.&#8221; <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72713 aligncenter\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/grassio.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/grassio.png 1391w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/grassio-768x476.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/grassio-782x485.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></p>\n<p>Reached via Twitter/X, Grass founder <strong>Andrej Radonjic</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity he&#8217;d never heard of a Superbox, and that Grass has no affiliation with the device maker.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It looks like these boxes are distributing an unethical proxy network which people are using to try to take advantage of Grass,&#8221; Radonjic said. &#8220;The point of grass is to be an opt-in network. You download the grass app to monetize your unused bandwidth. There are tons of sketchy SDKs out there that hijack people&#8217;s bandwidth to help webscraping companies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Radonjic said Grass has implemented &#8220;a robust system to identify network abusers,&#8221; and that if it discovers anyone trying to misuse or circumvent its terms of service, the company takes steps to stop it and prevent those users from earning points or rewards.</p>\n<p>Superbox&#8217;s parent company, <strong>Super Media Technology Company Ltd.</strong>, lists its street address as a UPS store in Fountain Valley, Calif. The company did not respond to multiple inquiries.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://behindmlm.com/mlm-reviews/grass-review-wynd-labs-securities-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this teardown by behindmlm.com</a>, a blog that covers multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, Grass&#8217;s compensation plan is built around &#8220;grass points,&#8221; which are earned through the use of the Grass app and through app usage by recruited affiliates. Affiliates can earn 5,000 grass points for clocking 100 hours usage of Grass’s app, but they must progress through ten affiliate tiers or ranks before they can redeem their grass points (presumably for some type of cryptocurrency). The 10th or &#8220;Titan&#8221; tier requires affiliates <em>to accumulate a whopping 50 million grass points, or recruit at least 221 more affiliates</em>.</p>\n<p>Radonjic said Grass&#8217;s system has changed in recent months, and confirmed the company has a referral program where users can earn Grass Uptime Points by contributing their own bandwidth and/or by inviting other users to participate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Users are not required to participate in the referral program to earn Grass Uptime Points or to receive Grass Tokens,&#8221; Radonjic said. &#8220;Grass is in the process of phasing out the referral program and has introduced an updated Grass Points model.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A review of the Terms and Conditions page for getgrass[.]io at the Wayback Machine shows Grass&#8217;s parent company has changed names at least five times in the course of its two-year existence. Searching the Wayback Machine on getgrass[.]io shows that in June 2023 Grass was owned by a company called <strong>Wynd Network</strong>. By March 2024, the owner was listed as <strong>Lower Tribeca Corp.</strong> in the Bahamas. By August 2024, Grass was controlled by a <strong>Half Space Labs Limited</strong>, and in November 2024 the company was owned by <strong>Grass OpCo (BVI) Ltd</strong>. Currently, the Grass website says its parent is just <strong>Grass OpCo Ltd</strong> (no BVI in the name).</p>\n<p>Radonjic acknowledged that Grass has undergone &#8220;a handful of corporate clean-ups over the last couple of years,&#8221; but described them as administrative changes that had no operational impact. &#8220;These reflect normal early-stage restructuring as the project moved from initial development&#8230;into the current structure under the Grass Foundation,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-72372\"></span></p>\n<h2>UNBOXING</h2>\n<p>Censys&#8217;s Ashley said the phone home to China&#8217;s Tencent QQ instant messaging service was the first red flag with the Superbox devices she examined. She also discovered the streaming boxes included powerful network analysis and remote access tools, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tcpdump</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netcat</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This thing DNS hijacked my router, did <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ARP poisoning</a> to the point where things fall off the network so they can assume that IP, and attempted to bypass controls,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have root on all of them now, and they actually have a folder called &#8216;secondstage.&#8217; These devices also have Netcat and Tcpdump on them, and yet they are supposed to be streaming devices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A quick online search shows various Superbox models and many similar Android streaming devices for sale at a wide range of top retail destinations, including <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>BestBuy</strong>, <strong>Newegg</strong>, and <strong>Walmart</strong>. Newegg.com, for example, currently lists more than three dozen Superbox models. In all cases, the products are sold by third-party merchants on these platforms, but in many instances the fulfillment comes from the e-commerce platform itself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Newegg is pretty bad now with these devices,&#8221; Ashley said. &#8220;Ebay is the funniest, because they have Superbox in Spanish &#8212; the SuperCaja &#8212; which is very popular.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72638\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/superbox-newegg.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72638\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72638\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/superbox-newegg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/superbox-newegg.png 1689w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/superbox-newegg-768x387.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/superbox-newegg-1536x773.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/superbox-newegg-782x394.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72638\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Superbox devices for sale via Newegg.com.</p></div>\n<p>Ashley said Amazon recently cracked down on Android streaming devices branded as Superbox, but that those listings can still be found under the more generic title &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=superbox&amp;crid=13MLUQ8V71EDD&amp;sprefix=superbo%2Caps%2C176&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">modem and router combo</a>&#8221; (which may be slightly closer to the truth about the device&#8217;s behavior).</p>\n<p>Superbox doesn&#8217;t advertise its products in the conventional sense. Rather, it seems to rely on lesser-known influencers on places like Youtube and TikTok to promote the devices.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "On the surface, the Superbox media streaming devices for sale at retailers like BestBuy and Walmart may seem like a steal: They offer unlimited access to more than 2,200 pay-per-view and streaming services like Netflix, ESPN and Hulu, all for a one-time fee of around $400. But security experts warn these TV boxes require intrusive software that forces the user’s network to relay Internet traffic for others, traffic that is often tied to cybercrime activity such as advertising fraud and account takeovers.\n\nSuperbox media streaming boxes for sale on Walmart.com.\n\nSuperbox bills itself as an affordable way for households to stream all of the television and movie content they could possibly want, without the hassle of monthly subscription fees — for a one-time payment of nearly $400.\n“Tired of confusing cable bills and hidden fees?,” Superbox’s website asks in a recent blog post titled, “Cheap Cable TV for Low Income: Watch TV, No Monthly Bills.”\n“Real cheap cable TV for low income solutions does exist,” the blog continues. “This guide breaks down the best alternatives to stop overpaying, from free over-the-air options to one-time purchase devices that eliminate monthly bills.”\nSuperbox claims that watching a stream of movies, TV shows, and sporting events won’t violate U.S. copyright law.\n“SuperBox is just like any other Android TV box on the market, we can not control what software customers will use,” the company’s website maintains. “And you won’t encounter a law issue unless uploading, downloading, or broadcasting content to a large group.”\n\nA blog post from the Superbox website.\n\nThere is nothing illegal about the sale or use of the Superbox itself, which can be used strictly as a way to stream content at providers where users already have a paid subscription. But that is not why people are shelling out $400 for these machines. The only way to watch those 2,200+ channels for free with a Superbox is to install several apps made for the device that enable them to stream this content.\nSuperbox’s homepage includes a prominent message stating the company does “not sell access to or preinstall any apps that bypass paywalls or provide access to unauthorized content.” The company explains that they merely provide the hardware, while customers choose which apps to install.\n“We only sell the hardware device,” the notice states. “Customers must use official apps and licensed services; unauthorized use may violate copyright law.”\nSuperbox is technically correct here, except for maybe the part about how customers must use official apps and licensed services: Before the Superbox can stream those thousands of channels, users must configure the device to update itself, and the first step involves ripping out Google’s official Play store and replacing it with something called the “App Store” or “Blue TV Store.”\nSuperbox does this because the device does not use the official Google-certified Android TV system, and its apps will not load otherwise. Only after the Google Play store has been supplanted by this unofficial App Store do the various movie and video streaming apps that are built specifically for the Superbox appear available for download (again, outside of Google’s app ecosystem).\nExperts say while these Android streaming boxes generally do what they advertise — enabling buyers to stream video content that would normally require a paid subscription — the apps that enable the streaming also ensnare the user’s Internet connection in a distributed residential proxy network that uses the devices to relay traffic from others.\nAshley is a senior solutions engineer at Censys, a cyber intelligence company that indexes Internet-connected devices, services and hosts. Ashley requested that only her first name be used in this story.\nIn a recent video interview, Ashley showed off several Superbox models that Censys was studying in the malware lab — including one purchased off the shelf at BestBuy.\n“I’m sure a lot of people are thinking, ‘Hey, how bad could it be if it’s for sale at the big box stores?'” she said. “But the more I looked, things got weirder and weirder.”\nAshley said she found the Superbox devices immediately contacted a server at the Chinese instant messaging service Tencent QQ, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass IO.\nGET GRASSED\nAlso known as getgrass[.]io, Grass says it is “a decentralized network that allows users to earn rewards by sharing their unused Internet bandwidth with AI labs and other companies.”\n“Buyers seek unused internet bandwidth to access a more diverse range of IP addresses, which enables them to see certain websites from a retail perspective,” the Grass website explains. “By utilizing your unused internet bandwidth, they can conduct market research, or perform tasks like web scraping to train AI.” \nReached via Twitter/X, Grass founder Andrej Radonjic told KrebsOnSecurity he’d never heard of a Superbox, and that Grass has no affiliation with the device maker.\n“It looks like these boxes are distributing an unethical proxy network which people are using to try to take advantage of Grass,” Radonjic said. “The point of grass is to be an opt-in network. You download the grass app to monetize your unused bandwidth. There are tons of sketchy SDKs out there that hijack people’s bandwidth to help webscraping companies.”\nRadonjic said Grass has implemented “a robust system to identify network abusers,” and that if it discovers anyone trying to misuse or circumvent its terms of service, the company takes steps to stop it and prevent those users from earning points or rewards.\nSuperbox’s parent company, Super Media Technology Company Ltd., lists its street address as a UPS store in Fountain Valley, Calif. The company did not respond to multiple inquiries.\nAccording to this teardown by behindmlm.com, a blog that covers multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, Grass’s compensation plan is built around “grass points,” which are earned through the use of the Grass app and through app usage by recruited affiliates. Affiliates can earn 5,000 grass points for clocking 100 hours usage of Grass’s app, but they must progress through ten affiliate tiers or ranks before they can redeem their grass points (presumably for some type of cryptocurrency). The 10th or “Titan” tier requires affiliates to accumulate a whopping 50 million grass points, or recruit at least 221 more affiliates.\nRadonjic said Grass’s system has changed in recent months, and confirmed the company has a referral program where users can earn Grass Uptime Points by contributing their own bandwidth and/or by inviting other users to participate.\n“Users are not required to participate in the referral program to earn Grass Uptime Points or to receive Grass Tokens,” Radonjic said. “Grass is in the process of phasing out the referral program and has introduced an updated Grass Points model.”\nA review of the Terms and Conditions page for getgrass[.]io at the Wayback Machine shows Grass’s parent company has changed names at least five times in the course of its two-year existence. Searching the Wayback Machine on getgrass[.]io shows that in June 2023 Grass was owned by a company called Wynd Network. By March 2024, the owner was listed as Lower Tribeca Corp. in the Bahamas. By August 2024, Grass was controlled by a Half Space Labs Limited, and in November 2024 the company was owned by Grass OpCo (BVI) Ltd. Currently, the Grass website says its parent is just Grass OpCo Ltd (no BVI in the name).\nRadonjic acknowledged that Grass has undergone “a handful of corporate clean-ups over the last couple of years,” but described them as administrative changes that had no operational impact. “These reflect normal early-stage restructuring as the project moved from initial development…into the current structure under the Grass Foundation,” he said.\n\nUNBOXING\nCensys’s Ashley said the phone home to China’s Tencent QQ instant messaging service was the first red flag with the Superbox devices she examined. She also discovered the streaming boxes included powerful network analysis and remote access tools, such as Tcpdump and Netcat.\n“This thing DNS hijacked my router, did ARP poisoning to the point where things fall off the network so they can assume that IP, and attempted to bypass controls,” she said. “I have root on all of them now, and they actually have a folder called ‘secondstage.’ These devices also have Netcat and Tcpdump on them, and yet they are supposed to be streaming devices.”\nA quick online search shows various Superbox models and many similar Android streaming devices for sale at a wide range of top retail destinations, including Amazon, BestBuy, Newegg, and Walmart. Newegg.com, for example, currently lists more than three dozen Superbox models. In all cases, the products are sold by third-party merchants on these platforms, but in many instances the fulfillment comes from the e-commerce platform itself.\n“Newegg is pretty bad now with these devices,” Ashley said. “Ebay is the funniest, because they have Superbox in Spanish — the SuperCaja — which is very popular.”\n\nSuperbox devices for sale via Newegg.com.\n\nAshley said Amazon recently cracked down on Android streaming devices branded as Superbox, but that those listings can still be found under the more generic title “modem and router combo” (which may be slightly closer to the truth about the device’s behavior).\nSuperbox doesn’t advertise its products in the conventional sense. Rather, it seems to rely on lesser-known influencers on places like Youtube and TikTok to promote the devices. Meanwhile, Ashley said, Superbox pays those influencers 50 percent of the value of each device they sell.\n“It’s weird to me because influencer marketing usually caps compensation at 15 percent, and it means they don’t care about the money,” she said. “This is about building their network.”\n\nA TikTok influencer casually mentions and promotes Superbox while chatting with her followers over a glass of wine.\n\nBADBOX\nAs plentiful as the Superbox is on e-commerce sites, it is just one brand in an ocean of no-name Android-based TV boxes available to consumers. While these devices generally do provide buyers with “free” streaming content, they also tend to include factory-installed malware or require the installation of third-party apps that engage the user’s Internet address in advertising fraud.\nIn July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants dubbed the “BadBox 2.0 Enterprise,” which Google described as a botnet of over ten million Android streaming devices that engaged in advertising fraud. Google said the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, can also infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.\n\nSome of the unofficial Android devices flagged by Google as part of the Badbox 2.0 botnet are still widely for sale at major e-commerce vendors. Image: Google.\n\nSeveral of the Android streaming devices flagged in Google’s lawsuit are still for sale on top U.S. retail sites. For example, searching for the “X88Pro 10” and the “T95” Android streaming boxes finds both continue to be peddled by Amazon sellers.\nGoogle’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malicious software prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors, usually during the set-up process.\n“Once these compromised IoT devices are connected to home networks, the infected devices are susceptible to becoming part of the BADBOX 2.0 botnet and residential proxy services known to be used for malicious activity,” the FBI said.\nThe FBI said BADBOX 2.0 was discovered after the original BADBOX campaign was disrupted in 2024.

Kilmer said Badbox 2.0 was used as a distribution platform for IPidea, a China-based entity that is now the world’s largest residential proxy network.\nKilmer and others say IPidea is merely a rebrand of 911S5 Proxy, a China-based proxy provider sanctioned last year by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for operating a botnet that helped criminals steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs (the U.S. Department of Justice also arrested the alleged owner of 911S5).\nHow are most IPidea customers using the proxy service?
