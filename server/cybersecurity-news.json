    "content:encoded": "<p>Two years ago, Americans anxious about the forthcoming 2024 presidential election were considering the malevolent force of an election influencer: artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen <a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/articles/then-and-now-how-does-ai-electoral-interference-compare-in-2025/\">plenty</a> <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1569115/full\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/technology/ai-elections-democracy.html\">warning</a> <a href=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/643ecb10be528d2c1da863cb/682f5ae442fffdff819ef830_TP%202025.2.pdf\">signs</a> from elections worldwide demonstrating how AI can be used to propagate misinformation and alter the political landscape, whether by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/us/politics/trump-meme-trolls-2024.html\">trolls</a> on social media, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/17/nx-s1-5079397/openai-chatgpt-iranian-group-us-election\">foreign</a> <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2025/02/07/algorithmic-invasions-how-information-warfare-threatens-nato-s-eastern-flank/index.html\">influencers</a>, or even a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-operative-admits-commissioning-fake-biden-robocall-used-ai-rcna140402\">street magician</a><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-operative-admits-commissioning-fake-biden-robocall-used-ai-rcna140402\">.</a> AI is poised to play a more volatile role than ever before in America&#8217;s next federal election in 2026. We can already see how different groups of political actors are approaching AI. Professional campaigners are using AI to accelerate the traditional tactics of electioneering; organizers are using it to reinvent how movements are built; and citizens are using it both to express themselves and amplify their side&#8217;s messaging. Because there are so few rules, and so little prospect of regulatory action, around AI&#8217;s role in politics, there is no oversight of these activities, and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for our democracy.</p>\n<h3>The Campaigners</h3>\n<p>Campaigners&#8212;messengers, ad buyers, fundraisers, and strategists&#8212;are focused on efficiency and optimization. To them, AI is a way to augment or even replace expensive humans who traditionally perform tasks like personalizing emails, texting donation solicitations, and deciding what platforms and audiences to target.</p>\n<p>This is an incremental evolution of the computerization of campaigning that has been underway for decades. For example, the progressive campaign infrastructure group Tech for Campaigns <a href=\"https://www.techforcampaigns.org/results/2024-results\">claims</a> it used AI in the 2024 cycle to reduce the time spent drafting fundraising solicitations by one-third. If AI is working well here, you won&#8217;t notice the difference between an annoying campaign solicitation written by a human staffer and an annoying one written by AI.</p>\n<p>But AI is scaling these capabilities, which is likely to make them even more ubiquitous. This will make the biggest difference for challengers to incumbents in safe seats, who see AI as both a tacitly useful tool and an attention-grabbing way to get their race into the headlines. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/underdog-who-beat-biden-in-american-samoa-used-ai-in-election-campaign-b0ce62d6\">Jason Palmer</a>, the little-known Democratic primary challenger to Joe Biden, successfully won the American Samoa primary while extensively leveraging AI avatars for campaigning.</p>\n<p>Such tactics were sometimes deployed as publicity stunts in the 2024 cycle; they were firsts that got attention. Pennsylvania Democratic Congressional candidate <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/12/democratic-campaign-ai-caller-00131180\">Shamaine Daniels</a> became the first to use a conversational AI robocaller in 2023. Two long-shot challengers to Rep. Don Beyer used an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/virginia-congressional-candidate-creates-ai-chatbot-debate-stand-in-incumbent-2024-10-08/\">AI avatar</a> to represent the incumbent in a live debate last October after he declined to participate. In 2026, voters who have seen years of the official White House X account posting deepfaked <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg8zkz8d0o\">memes</a> of Donald Trump will be desensitized to the use of AI in political communications.</p>\n<p>Strategists are also turning to AI to interpret public opinion data and provide more <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-024-02150-4\">fine-grained insight</a> into the perspective of different voters. This might sound like AIs replacing people in opinion polls, but it is really a <a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/using-ai-for-political-polling/\">continuation</a> of the evolution of political polling into a data-driven science over the last several decades.</p>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://theaapc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AAPC-Foundation-AI-Presentation-Public-Release-v4.pptx.pdf\">survey</a> by the American Association of Political Consultants found that a majority of their members&#8217; firms already use AI regularly in their work, and more than 40 percent believe it will &#8220;fundamentally transform&#8221; the future of their profession. If these emerging AI tools become popular in the midterms, it won&#8217;t just be a few candidates from the tightest national races texting you three times a day. It may also be the member of Congress in the safe district next to you, and your state representative, and your school board members.</p>\n<p>The development and use of AI in campaigning is different depending on what side of the aisle you look at. On the Republican side, Push Digital Group is going &#8220;<a href=\"https://campaignsandelections.com/industry-news/gop-firm-bets-big-on-artificial-intelligenc/\">all in</a>&#8221; on a new AI <a href=\"https://pushdigitalgroup.com/blog/push-digital-group-launches-push-ai/\">initiative</a>, using the technology to create hundreds of ad variants for their clients automatically, as well as assisting with strategy, targeting, and data analysis. On the other side, the National Democratic Training Committee recently released a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/democrats-midterm-elections-ai/\">playbook</a> for using AI. <a href=\"https://shortyawards.com/16th/quillerai\">Quiller</a> is building an AI-powered fundraising platform aimed at drastically reducing the time campaigns spend producing emails and texts. Progressive-aligned startups <a href=\"https://www.chorusai.co\">Chorus AI</a> and <a href=\"https://campaignsandelections.com/industry-news/startup-bets-on-ai-ads-for-politics/\">BattlegroundAI</a> are offering AI tools for automatically generating ads for use on social media and other digital platforms. <a href=\"https://www.donoratlas.com\">DonorAtlas</a> automates data collection on potential donors, and <a href=\"https://www.hillandstate.com/rivalmindai\">RivalMind AI</a> focuses on political research and strategy, automating the production of candidate dossiers.</p>\n<p>For now, there seems to be an investment gap between Democratic- and Republican-aligned technology innovators. Progressive venture fund <a href=\"https://highergroundlabs.com\">Higher Ground Labs</a> boasts $50 million in deployed investments since 2017 and a significant <a href=\"https://highergroundlabs.com/ai/\">focus on AI</a>. Republican-aligned counterparts operate on a much smaller scale. Startup Caucus has announced one investment&#8212;of $50,000&#8212;since 2022. The <a href=\"https://www.campaigninnovation.org\">Center for Campaign Innovation</a> funds research projects and events, not companies. This echoes a longstanding gap in campaign technology between Democratic- and Republican-aligned <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/whos-funding-the-2024-election/\">fundraising platforms</a> ActBlue and WinRed, which has landed the former in Republicans&#8217; political <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/09/actblue-letter-republican-congressional-investigation-00394531\">crosshairs</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all campaign technology innovations will be visible. In 2016, the Trump campaign vocally eschewed using <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-scorning-of-data-may-not-hurt-him-but-itll-hurt-the-gop/\">data</a> to drive campaign strategy and appeared to be falling way <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news\">behind</a> on ad spending, but was&#8212;we learned in retrospect&#8212;<a href=\"https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/the-45th-how-the-trump-campaigns-digital-strategy-made-history/\">actually</a> leaning heavily into digital advertising and making use of new controversial mechanisms for accessing and exploiting voters&#8217; social media data with vendor <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/cambridge-analytica-controversy/\">Cambridge Analytica</a>. The most impactful uses of AI in the 2026 midterms may not be known until 2027 or beyond.</p>\n<h3>The Organizers</h3>\n<p>Beyond the realm of political consultants driving ad buys and fundraising appeals, organizers are using AI in ways that feel more radically new.</p>\n<p>The hypothetical potential of AI to drive political movements was illustrated in 2022 when a Danish artist collective used an AI model to found a political party, the <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/this-danish-political-party-is-led-by-an-ai/\">Synthetic Party</a>, and generate its policy goals. This was more of an art project than a popular movement, but it demonstrated that AIs&#8212;synthesizing the expressions and policy interests of humans&#8212;can formulate a political platform. In 2025, Denmark hosted a &#8220;<a href=\"https://kunsthalaarhus.dk/en/Exhibitions/Synthetic-Summit\">summit</a>&#8221; of eight such AI political agents where attendees could witness &#8220;continuously orchestrate[d] algorithmic micro-assemblies, spontaneous deliberations, and impromptu policy-making&#8221; by the participating AIs.</p>\n<p>The more viable version of this concept lies in the use of AIs to facilitate deliberation. AIs are being used to help <a href=\"https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf\">legislators</a> collect input from constituents and to hold large-scale <a href=\"https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/1556/\">citizen assemblies</a>. This kind of AI-driven &#8220;<a href=\"https://proceedings.open.tudelft.nl/DGO2025/article/view/953\">sensemaking</a>&#8221; may play a powerful role in the future of public policy. Some <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2852\">research</a> has suggested that AI can be as or more effective than humans in helping people find common ground on controversial policy issues.</p>\n<p>Another movement for &#8220;<a href=\"https://publicai.network\">Public AI</a>&#8221; is focused on wresting AI from the hands of corporations to put people, through their governments, in control. Civic technologists in national governments from <a href=\"https://sea-lion.ai\">Singapore</a>, <a href=\"https://abci.ai/en/\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ai.se/en/project/eurolingua-gpt\">Sweden</a>, and <a href=\"https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/07/a-language-model-built-for-the-public-good.html\">Switzerland</a> are building their own alternatives to Big Tech AI models, for use in public administration and distribution as a <a href=\"https://economicsecurityproject.org/resource/the-global-rise-of-public-ai/\">public good</a>.</p>\n<p>Labor organizers have a particularly interesting relationship to AI. At the same time that they are <a href=\"https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/a-first-look-at-labors-ai-values/\">galvanizing</a> mass resistance against the replacement or endangerment of human workers by AI, many are racing to leverage the technology in their own work to build power.</p>\n<p>Some entrepreneurial organizers have used AI in the past few years as <a href=\"https://unitedworkers.org.au/archive/unions-mobilise-ai-to-turn-the-tables-on-wage-theft-in-hospitality/\">tools</a> for activating, connecting, answering questions for, and providing guidance to their members. In the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.agileunions.ai/\">Centre for Responsible Union AI</a> studies and promotes the use of AI by unions; they&#8217;ve published several <a href=\"https://www.agileunions.ai/t/Case%20studies%20and%20use%20cases\">case studies</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.agileunions.ai/p/case-study-repcoach-pcs-union-reps-practice-recruitment-conversations\">UK Public and Commercial Services Union</a> has used AI to help their reps simulate recruitment conversations before going into the field. The Belgian union <a href=\"https://www.agileunions.ai/p/acv-cvs-trial-shared-inboxes\">ACV-CVS</a> has used AI to sort hundreds of emails per day from members to help them respond more efficiently. Software companies such as <a href=\"https://www.quorum.us/solutions/grassroots-advocacy/\">Quorum</a> are increasingly offering AI-driven products to cater to the needs of organizers and grassroots campaigns.</p>\n<p>But unions have also leveraged AI for its symbolic power. In the U.S., the Screen Actors Guild held up the specter of AI displacement of creative labor to attract public attention and sympathy, and the ETUC (the European confederation of trade unions) developed a <a href=\"https://etuc.org/en/document/artificial-intelligence-workers-not-just-profit-ensuring-quality-jobs-digital-age\">policy platform</a> for responding to AI.</p>\n<p>Finally, some union organizers have leveraged AI in more provocative ways. Some have applied it to hacking the &#8220;bossware&#8221; AI to <a href=\"https://www.etui.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/Exercising%20workers%20rights%20in%20algorithmic%20management%20systems_Lessons%20learned%20from%20the%20Glovo-Foodinho%20digital%20labour%20platform%20case_2023.pdf\">subvert</a> the exploitative intent or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-army-union-busters-amazon/\">disrupt</a> the anti-union practices of their managers.</p>\n<h3>The Citizens</h3>\n<p>Many of the tasks we&#8217;ve talked about so far are familiar use cases to anyone working in office and management settings: writing emails, providing user (or voter, or member) support, doing research.</p>\n<p>But even mundane tasks, when automated at scale and targeted at specific ends, can be pernicious. AI is not neutral. It can be applied by many actors for many purposes. In the hands of the most numerous and diverse actors in a democracy&#8212;the citizens&#8212;that has profound implications.</p>\n<p>Conservative activists in Georgia and Florida have used a tool named <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/conservative-activists-errors-software-voter-fraud-rcna161028\">EagleAI</a> to automate challenging voter registration en masse (although the tool&#8217;s creator later <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-voter-removal-software-eagleai-266ead9198da7d54421798e8a1577d26\">denied</a> that it uses AI). In a nonpartisan electoral management context with access to accurate data sources, such automated review of electoral registrations might be useful and effective. In this hyperpartisan context, AI merely serves to amplify the proclivities of activists at the extreme of their movements. This trend will continue unabated in 2026.</p>\n<p>Of course, citizens can use AI to safeguard the integrity of elections. In Ghana&#8217;s 2024 presidential election, civic organizations used an AI tool to automatically detect and mitigate electoral <a href=\"https://penplusbytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ahead-Africa-DDP-Final-Report-2025.pdf\">disinformation</a><a href=\"https://penplusbytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ahead-Africa-DDP-Final-Report-2025.pdf\"> spread on social media</a>. The same year, <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/redefining-ai-for-africa-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-kenyas-grassroots-movement/\">Kenyan protesters</a> developed specialized chatbots to distribute information about a controversial finance bill in Parliament and instances of government corruption.</p>\n<p>So far, the biggest way Americans have leveraged AI in politics is in self-expression. About <a href=\"https://resist.bot/news/2023/03/08/resistbot-at-six-building-a-community\">ten million Americans</a> have used the chatbot Resistbot to help draft and send messages to their elected leaders. It&#8217;s hard to find statistics on how widely adopted tools like this are, but researchers have <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09747\">estimated</a> that, as of 2024, about one in five consumer complaints to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was written with the assistance of AI.</p>\n<p>OpenAI operates security programs to <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/5f73af09-a3a3-4a55-992e-069237681620/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-june-2025.pdf\">disrupt</a> foreign influence operations and maintains <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/04/16/openai-safety-framework-manipulation-deception-critical-risk/\">restrictions</a> on political use in its terms of service, but this is <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/self-regulation-won-t-prevent-problematic-political-uses-of-generative-ai\">hardly sufficient</a> to deter use of AI technologies for whatever purpose. And widely available free models give anyone the ability to attempt this on their own.</p>\n<p>But this could change. The most ominous sign of AI&#8217;s potential to disrupt elections is not the deepfakes and misinformation. Rather, it may be the use of AI by the Trump administration to <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/article/trumps-immigration-crackdown-built-ai-surveillance-and-disregard-due-process\">surveil and punish</a> political speech on social media and other online platforms. The scalability and sophistication of AI tools give governments with authoritarian intent unprecedented power to police and selectively limit political speech.</p>\n<h3>What About the Midterms?</h3>\n<p>These examples illustrate AI&#8217;s pluripotent role as a force multiplier. The same technology used by different actors&#8212;campaigners, organizers, citizens, and governments&#8212;leads to wildly different impacts. We can&#8217;t know for sure what the net result will be. In the end, it will be the interactions and intersections of these uses that matters, and their unstable dynamics will make future elections even more unpredictable than in the past.</p>\n<p>For now, the decisions of how and when to use AI lie largely with individuals and the political entities they lead.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Two years ago, Americans anxious about the forthcoming 2024 presidential election were considering the malevolent force of an election influencer: artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen plenty of warning signs from elections worldwide demonstrating how AI can be used to propagate misinformation and alter the political landscape, whether by trolls on social media, foreign influencers, or even a street magician. AI is poised to play a more volatile role than ever before in America’s next federal election in 2026. We can already see how different groups of political actors are approaching AI. Professional campaigners are using AI to accelerate the traditional tactics of electioneering; organizers are using it to reinvent how movements are built; and citizens are using it both to express themselves and amplify their side’s messaging. Because there are so few rules, and so little prospect of regulatory action, around AI’s role in politics, there is no oversight of these activities, and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for our democracy.\nThe Campaigners\nCampaigners—messengers, ad buyers, fundraisers, and strategists—are focused on efficiency and optimization. To them, AI is a way to augment or even replace expensive humans who traditionally perform tasks like personalizing emails, texting donation solicitations, and deciding what platforms and audiences to target.\nThis is an incremental evolution of the computerization of campaigning that has been underway for decades. For example, the progressive campaign infrastructure group Tech for Campaigns claims it used AI in the 2024 cycle to reduce the time spent drafting fundraising solicitations by one-third. If AI is working well here, you won’t notice the difference between an annoying campaign solicitation written by a human staffer and an annoying one written by AI.\nBut AI is scaling these capabilities, which is likely to make them even more ubiquitous. This will make the biggest difference for challengers to incumbents in safe seats, who see AI as both a tacitly useful tool and an attention-grabbing way to get their race into the headlines. Jason Palmer, the little-known Democratic primary challenger to Joe Biden, successfully won the American Samoa primary while extensively leveraging AI avatars for campaigning.\nSuch tactics were sometimes deployed as publicity stunts in the 2024 cycle; they were firsts that got attention. Pennsylvania Democratic Congressional candidate Shamaine Daniels became the first to use a conversational AI robocaller in 2023. Two long-shot challengers to Rep. Don Beyer used an AI avatar to represent the incumbent in a live debate last October after he declined to participate. In 2026, voters who have seen years of the official White House X account posting deepfaked memes of Donald Trump will be desensitized to the use of AI in political communications.\nStrategists are also turning to AI to interpret public opinion data and provide more fine-grained insight into the perspective of different voters. This might sound like AIs replacing people in opinion polls, but it is really a continuation of the evolution of political polling into a data-driven science over the last several decades.\nA recent survey by the American Association of Political Consultants found that a majority of their members’ firms already use AI regularly in their work, and more than 40 percent believe it will “fundamentally transform” the future of their profession. If these emerging AI tools become popular in the midterms, it won’t just be a few candidates from the tightest national races texting you three times a day. It may also be the member of Congress in the safe district next to you, and your state representative, and your school board members.\nThe development and use of AI in campaigning is different depending on what side of the aisle you look at. On the Republican side, Push Digital Group is going “all in” on a new AI initiative, using the technology to create hundreds of ad variants for their clients automatically, as well as assisting with strategy, targeting, and data analysis. On the other side, the National Democratic Training Committee recently released a playbook for using AI. Quiller is building an AI-powered fundraising platform aimed at drastically reducing the time campaigns spend producing emails and texts. Progressive-aligned startups Chorus AI and BattlegroundAI are offering AI tools for automatically generating ads for use on social media and other digital platforms. DonorAtlas automates data collection on potential donors, and RivalMind AI focuses on political research and strategy, automating the production of candidate dossiers.\nFor now, there seems to be an investment gap between Democratic- and Republican-aligned technology innovators. Progressive venture fund Higher Ground Labs boasts $50 million in deployed investments since 2017 and a significant focus on AI. Republican-aligned counterparts operate on a much smaller scale. Startup Caucus has announced one investment—of $50,000—since 2022. The Center for Campaign Innovation funds research projects and events, not companies. This echoes a longstanding gap in campaign technology between Democratic- and Republican-aligned fundraising platforms ActBlue and WinRed, which has landed the former in Republicans’ political crosshairs.\nOf course, not all campaign technology innovations will be visible. In 2016, the Trump campaign vocally eschewed using data to drive campaign strategy and appeared to be falling way behind on ad spending, but was—we learned in retrospect—actually leaning heavily into digital advertising and making use of new controversial mechanisms for accessing and exploiting voters’ social media data with vendor Cambridge Analytica. The most impactful uses of AI in the 2026 midterms may not be known until 2027 or beyond.\nThe Organizers\nBeyond the realm of political consultants driving ad buys and fundraising appeals, organizers are using AI in ways that feel more radically new.\nThe hypothetical potential of AI to drive political movements was illustrated in 2022 when a Danish artist collective used an AI model to found a political party, the Synthetic Party, and generate its policy goals. This was more of an art project than a popular movement, but it demonstrated that AIs—synthesizing the expressions and policy interests of humans—can formulate a political platform. In 2025, Denmark hosted a “summit” of eight such AI political agents where attendees could witness “continuously orchestrate[d] algorithmic micro-assemblies, spontaneous deliberations, and impromptu policy-making” by the participating AIs.\nThe more viable version of this concept lies in the use of AIs to facilitate deliberation. AIs are being used to help legislators collect input from constituents and to hold large-scale citizen assemblies. This kind of AI-driven “sensemaking” may play a powerful role in the future of public policy. Some research has suggested that AI can be as or more effective than humans in helping people find common ground on controversial policy issues.\nAnother movement for “Public AI” is focused on wresting AI from the hands of corporations to put people, through their governments, in control. Civic technologists in national governments from Singapore, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland are building their own alternatives to Big Tech AI models, for use in public administration and distribution as a public good.\nLabor organizers have a particularly interesting relationship to AI. At the same time that they are galvanizing mass resistance against the replacement or endangerment of human workers by AI, many are racing to leverage the technology in their own work to build power.\nSome entrepreneurial organizers have used AI in the past few years as tools for activating, connecting, answering questions for, and providing guidance to their members. In the UK, the Centre for Responsible Union AI studies and promotes the use of AI by unions; they’ve published several case studies. The UK Public and Commercial Services Union has used AI to help their reps simulate recruitment conversations before going into the field. The Belgian union ACV-CVS has used AI to sort hundreds of emails per day from members to help them respond more efficiently. Software companies such as Quorum are increasingly offering AI-driven products to cater to the needs of organizers and grassroots campaigns.\nBut unions have also leveraged AI for its symbolic power. In the U.S., the Screen Actors Guild held up the specter of AI displacement of creative labor to attract public attention and sympathy, and the ETUC (the European confederation of trade unions) developed a policy platform for responding to AI.\nFinally, some union organizers have leveraged AI in more provocative ways. Some have applied it to hacking the “bossware” AI to subvert the exploitative intent or disrupt the anti-union practices of their managers.\nThe Citizens\nMany of the tasks we’ve talked about so far are familiar use cases to anyone working in office and management settings: writing emails, providing user (or voter, or member) support, doing research.\nBut even mundane tasks, when automated at scale and targeted at specific ends, can be pernicious. AI is not neutral. It can be applied by many actors for many purposes. In the hands of the most numerous and diverse actors in a democracy—the citizens—that has profound implications.\nConservative activists in Georgia and Florida have used a tool named EagleAI to automate challenging voter registration en masse (although the tool’s creator later denied that it uses AI). In a nonpartisan electoral management context with access to accurate data sources, such automated review of electoral registrations might be useful and effective. In this hyperpartisan context, AI merely serves to amplify the proclivities of activists at the extreme of their movements. This trend will continue unabated in 2026.\nOf course, citizens can use AI to safeguard the integrity of elections. In Ghana’s 2024 presidential election, civic organizations used an AI tool to automatically detect and mitigate electoral disinformation spread on social media. The same year, Kenyan protesters developed specialized chatbots to distribute information about a controversial finance bill in Parliament and instances of government corruption.\nSo far, the biggest way Americans have leveraged AI in politics is in self-expression. About ten million Americans have used the chatbot Resistbot to help draft and send messages to their elected leaders. It’s hard to find statistics on how widely adopted tools like this are, but researchers have estimated that, as of 2024, about one in five consumer complaints to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was written with the assistance of AI.\nOpenAI operates security programs to disrupt foreign influence operations and maintains restrictions on political use in its terms of service, but this is hardly sufficient to deter use of AI technologies for whatever purpose. And widely available free models give anyone the ability to attempt this on their own.\nBut this could change. The most ominous sign of AI’s potential to disrupt elections is not the deepfakes and misinformation. Rather, it may be the use of AI by the Trump administration to surveil and punish political speech on social media and other online platforms. The scalability and sophistication of AI tools give governments with authoritarian intent unprecedented power to police and selectively limit political speech.\nWhat About the Midterms?\nThese examples illustrate AI’s pluripotent role as a force multiplier. The same technology used by different actors—campaigners, organizers, citizens, and governments—leads to wildly different impacts. We can’t know for sure what the net result will be. In the end, it will be the interactions and intersections of these uses that matters, and their unstable dynamics will make future elections even more unpredictable than in the past.\nFor now, the decisions of how and when to use AI lie largely with individuals and the political entities they lead. Whether or not you personally trust AI to write an email for you or make a decision about you hardly matters. If a campaign, an interest group, or a fellow citizen trusts it for that purpose, they are free to use it.\nIt seems unlikely that Congress or the Trump administration will put guardrails around the use of AI in politics. AI companies have rapidly emerged as among the biggest lobbyists in Washington, reportedly dumping $100 million toward preventing regulation, with a focus on influencing candidate behavior before the midterm elections. The Trump administration seems open and responsive to their appeals.\nThe ultimate effect of AI on the midterms will largely depend on the experimentation happening now. Candidates and organizations across the political spectrum have ample opportunity—but a ticking clock—to find effective ways to use the technology. Those that do will have little to stop them from exploiting it.\nThis essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in The American Prospect.",

    "content:encoded": "<p>The world&#8217;s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>\n<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>\n<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>\n<p>As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>\n<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72353\" style=\"width: 753px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72353\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-72353\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"743\" height=\"93\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-768x96.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t-782x98.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72353\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.</p></div>\n<p>Aisuru&#8217;s overlords aren&#8217;t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>\n<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>\n<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>\n<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>\n<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href=\"https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72328\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72328\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-72328\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru.png 1436w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru-768x468.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru-782x476.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28  can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic.

The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.</p></div>\n<h2>BOTNETS R US</h2>\n<p>Ferguson said he&#8217;s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet&#8217;s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>\n<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote pqright\">&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said.</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href=\"https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;<span id=\"more-72321\"></span></p>\n<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>\n<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaked in 2016</a> by <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_36755\" style=\"width: 743px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36755\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-36755\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"733\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-36755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.</p></div>\n<p>Dobbins said Aisuru&#8217;s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.</p>\n<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>\n<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72354\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72354\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72354\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"706\" height=\"190\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72354\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025.

That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky&#8217;s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-71314\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png 779w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></p>\n<p>Like the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called <strong>Botshield</strong>.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "The world’s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet’s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.\nSince its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.\nThe hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru’s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.\nAs Aisuru’s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google’s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.\nBy late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru’s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.\n\nA measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.\n\nAisuru’s overlords aren’t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.\nFor the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet’s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.\nSteven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.\nFerguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.\n“This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,” he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.\nTraces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.\n\nAn Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28  can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\n\nPaging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.\n\nMultiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.\n\nBOTNETS R US\nFerguson said he’s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet’s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.\nAT&T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.\n“The impact extends beyond victim networks,” Ferguson said. “For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast’s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.”\nRoland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.\n“The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,” Dobbin said. “We’re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.”\n“The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,” Dobbins continued. “A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there’s going to be a period ahead where there’s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.”\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson’s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.\n“In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,” Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. “With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.”\nA spokesperson for Comcast responded, “Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.”\n9 YEARS OF MIRAI\nAisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016 by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.\nThe Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.\n\nA depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.\n\nDobbins said Aisuru’s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.\n“The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,” he said. “And that’s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.”\nThe Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle “9gigsofram,” which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.\nRobert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik “9gigsofram” Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru’s botmasters chose Buckingham’s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.\n“The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,” Coelho said.\nCoelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn’t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.\n“It’s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,” he said.\nRAPID SPREAD\nAisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru’s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.\n“Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,” XLab wrote on September 15. “The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.”\n\nA malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.\n\nAisuru’s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.\nOnce Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru’s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government’s takedown, Dobbins said.\n“Folks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that’s great, but unfortunately the botnet’s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,” he said. “The problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.”\n\nA screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name “Ethan J. Foltz” in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.\n\nBOTMASTERS AT LARGE\nXLab’s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: “Snow,” who’s responsible for botnet development; “Tom,” tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and “Forky,” responsible for botnet sales.\nKrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky’s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.\n\nLike the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP’s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.\nIn our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.\nReached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).\nBut after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.\nAt this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.\n“I’m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,” Forky replied. “They’re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.”",

Also in August, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/google-says-its-ai-based-bug-hunter-found-20-security-vulnerabilities/\">announced</a> that its Big Sleep AI found dozens of new vulnerabilities in open-source projects.</p>\n<p>It gets worse.

In August, Anthropic reported that they disrupted a threat actor that used Claude, Anthropic&#8217;s AI model, to <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-countering-misuse-aug-2025\">automate</a> the entire cyberattack process. It was an impressive use of the AI, which performed network reconnaissance, penetrated networks, and harvested victims&#8217; credentials. The AI was able to figure out which data to steal, how much money to extort out of the victims, and how to best write extortion emails.</p>\n<p>Another hacker used Claude to create and market his own ransomware, complete with &#8220;advanced evasion capabilities, encryption, and anti-recovery mechanisms.&#8221; And in September, Checkpoint <a href=\"https://blog.checkpoint.com/executive-insights/hexstrike-ai-when-llms-meet-zero-day-exploitation/\">reported</a> on hackers using HexStrike-AI to create autonomous agents that can scan, exploit, and persist inside target networks. Also in September, a research team <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01835\">showed</a> how they can quickly and easily reproduce hundreds of vulnerabilities from public information. These tools are increasingly free for anyone to use. <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/chinese-ai-villager-pen-testing/\">Villager</a>, a recently released AI pentesting tool from Chinese company Cyberspike, uses the Deepseek model to completely automate attack chains.</p>\n<p>This is all well beyond AIs capabilities in 2016, at DARPA&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/news/2016/cyber-grand-challenge-winners\">Cyber Grand Challenge</a>.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "AI agents are now hacking computers. They’re getting better at all phases of cyberattacks, faster than most of us expected. They can chain together different aspects of a cyber operation, and hack autonomously, at computer speeds and scale. This is going to change everything.\nOver the summer, hackers proved the concept, industry institutionalized it, and criminals operationalized it. In June, AI company XBOW took the top spot on HackerOne’s US leaderboard after submitting over 1,000 new vulnerabilities in just a few months. In August, the seven teams competing in DARPA’s AI Cyber Challenge collectively found 54 new vulnerabilities in a target system, in four hours (of compute). Also in August, Google announced that its Big Sleep AI found dozens of new vulnerabilities in open-source projects.\nIt gets worse. In July Ukraine’s CERT discovered a piece of Russian malware that used an LLM to automate the cyberattack process, generating both system reconnaissance and data theft commands in real-time. In August, Anthropic reported that they disrupted a threat actor that used Claude, Anthropic’s AI model, to automate the entire cyberattack process. It was an impressive use of the AI, which performed network reconnaissance, penetrated networks, and harvested victims’ credentials. The AI was able to figure out which data to steal, how much money to extort out of the victims, and how to best write extortion emails.\nAnother hacker used Claude to create and market his own ransomware, complete with “advanced evasion capabilities, encryption, and anti-recovery mechanisms.” And in September, Checkpoint reported on hackers using HexStrike-AI to create autonomous agents that can scan, exploit, and persist inside target networks. Also in September, a research team showed how they can quickly and easily reproduce hundreds of vulnerabilities from public information. These tools are increasingly free for anyone to use. Villager, a recently released AI pentesting tool from Chinese company Cyberspike, uses the Deepseek model to completely automate attack chains.\nThis is all well beyond AIs capabilities in 2016, at DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge. The annual Chinese AI hacking challenge, Robot Hacking Games, might be on this level, but little is known outside of China.\nTipping point on the horizon\nAI agents now rival and sometimes surpass even elite human hackers in sophistication. They automate operations at machine speed and global scale. The scope of their capabilities allows these AI agents to completely automate a criminal’s command to maximize profit, or structure advanced attacks to a government’s precise specifications, such as to avoid detection.\nIn this future, attack capabilities could accelerate beyond our individual and collective capability to handle. We have long taken it for granted that we have time to patch systems after vulnerabilities become known, or that withholding vulnerability details prevents attackers from exploiting them. This is no longer the case.\nThe cyberattack/cyberdefense balance has long skewed towards the attackers; these developments threaten to tip the scales completely. We’re potentially looking at a singularity event for cyber attackers. Key parts of the attack chain are becoming automated and integrated: persistence, obfuscation, command-and-control, and endpoint evasion. Vulnerability research could potentially be carried out during operations instead of months in advance.\nThe most skilled will likely retain an edge for now. But AI agents don’t have to be better at a human task in order to be useful. They just have to excel in one of four dimensions: speed, scale, scope, or sophistication. But there is every indication that they will eventually excel at all four. By reducing the skill, cost, and time required to find and exploit flaws, AI can turn rare expertise into commodity capabilities and gives average criminals an outsized advantage.\nThe AI-assisted evolution of cyberdefense\nAI technologies can benefit defenders as well. We don’t know how the different technologies of cyber-offense and cyber-defense will be amenable to AI enhancement, but we can extrapolate a possible series of overlapping developments.\nPhrase One: The Transformation of the Vulnerability Researcher. AI-based hacking benefits defenders as well as attackers. In this scenario, AI empowers defenders to do more. It simplifies capabilities, providing far more people the ability to perform previously complex tasks, and empowers researchers previously busy with these tasks to accelerate or move beyond them, freeing time to work on problems that require human creativity. History suggests a pattern. Reverse engineering was a laborious manual process until tools such as IDA Pro made the capability available to many. AI vulnerability discovery could follow a similar trajectory, evolving through scriptable interfaces, automated workflows, and automated research before reaching broad accessibility.\nPhase Two: The Emergence of VulnOps.

These products may emerge as a SaaS platform, or some internal operational framework, or something entirely different. Think of it as AI-assisted vulnerability research available to everyone, at scale, repeatable, and integrated into enterprise operations.\nPhase Three: The Disruption of the Enterprise Software Model. If enterprises adopt AI-powered security the way they adopted continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), several paths open up. AI vulnerability discovery could become a built-in stage in delivery pipelines. We can envision a world where AI vulnerability discovery becomes an integral part of the software development process, where vulnerabilities are automatically patched even before reaching production—a shift we might call continuous discovery/continuous repair (CD/CR). Third-party risk management (TPRM) offers a natural adoption route, lower-risk vendor testing, integration into procurement and certification gates, and a proving ground before wider rollout.\nPhase Four: The Self-Healing Network.
