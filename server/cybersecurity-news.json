    "content:encoded": "<p>For <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq2q5jnw3o\">two days</a> in September, Afghanistan had <a href=\"https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/country/AF?from=1759067186&amp;until=1759326386&amp;view=view1\">no internet</a>. No satellite failed; no cable was cut. This was a deliberate outage, mandated by the Taliban government. It followed a more localized shutdown two weeks prior, reportedly instituted &#8220;to prevent immoral activities.&#8221; No additional explanation was given. The timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse: communities still reeling from a major earthquake <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistans-cellphone-internet-services-down-monitoring-shows-2025-09-30/\">lost emergency communications</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqdy5nrlqo\">flights were grounded</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/03/asia/afghanistan-internet-shutdown-intl-hnk-dst\">banking was interrupted</a>. Afghanistan&#8217;s blackout is part of a wider pattern. Just since the end of September, there were also major nationwide internet shutdowns in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0x8vdvkjgo\">Tanzania</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39665244\">Cameroon</a>, and significant regional shutdowns in <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/3/why-has-pakistan-administered-kashmir-erupted-in-protest-again\">Pakistan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/09/internet-shutdowns-record-high-africa-2024-access-weaponised\">Nigeria</a>. In all cases but <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/3/why-has-pakistan-administered-kashmir-erupted-in-protest-again\">one</a>, authorities offered no official justification or acknowledgment, leaving millions unable to access information, contact loved ones, or express themselves through moments of crisis, elections, and protests.</p>\n<p>The frequency of deliberate internet shutdowns has skyrocketed since the first notable example <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-12306041\">in Egypt in 2011</a>. Together with our colleagues at the digital rights organisation Access Now and the #KeepItOn coalition, <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton-data-dashboard/\">we&#8217;ve tracked</a> 296 deliberate internet shutdowns in 54 countries <a href=\"https://accessnow.org/keepiton-2024-report\">in 2024</a>, and at least 244 more in 2025 so far.</p>\n<p>This is more than an inconvenience. The internet has become an essential piece of infrastructure, affecting how we live, work, and get our information. It&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/06/internet-shutdowns-un-report-details-dramatic-impact-peoples-lives-and-human\">major enabler</a> of human rights, and turning off the internet can worsen or conceal <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/mena-keepiton-internet-shutdowns-2023-en/\">a spectrum</a> of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/bangladesh-student-protests-over-jobs-escalate-telecoms-disrupted\">abuses</a>. These shutdowns silence societies, and they&#8217;re getting more and more common.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/A-taxonomy-of-internet-shutdowns-the-technologies-behind-network-interference.pdf\">Shutdowns</a> can be local or national, partial or total. In total blackouts, like Afghanistan or Tanzania, nothing works. But shutdowns are often targeted more granularly. Cellphone internet could be blocked, but not broadband. Specific news sites, social media platforms, and messaging systems could be blocked, leaving overall network access unaffected&#8212;as when Brazil <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y06vzk3yjo\">shut off</a> X (formerly Twitter) in 2024. Sometimes bandwidth is just <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2021/four-ways-governments-disrupt-internet-access/\">throttled</a>, making everything slower and unreliable.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, internet shutdowns are used in political or military operations. In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/who-is-shutting-down-the-internet-in-ukraine/\">Russia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/russian-state-media-company-hit-by-unprecedented-cyberattack-kremlin-says-2024-10-07/\">Ukraine</a> have shut off parts of each other&#8217;s internet, and Israel has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-hit-by-telecoms-blackout-israeli-tanks-advance-2025-09-18/\">repeatedly shut off</a> Palestinians&#8217; internet in Gaza. Shutdowns of this type happened <a href=\"http://accessnow.org/keepiton-2024-report\">25 times in 2024</a>, affecting people in 13 countries.</p>\n<p>Reasons for the shutdowns are as varied as the countries that perpetrate them. General information control is just one. Shutdowns often come in response to political unrest, as governments try to prevent people from organizing and getting information; Panama had a <a href=\"https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/shutdowns/telecom-shutdown-in-bocas-del-toro/\">regional shutdown</a> this summer in response to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/panama-protests-chiquita-banana-cd8c42c8cb695c2e39ee6fb3ec886388\">protests</a>. Or during elections, as opposition parties utilize the internet to mobilize supporters and communicate strategy. Belarusian president <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjdzyzxd97o\">Alyaksandr Lukashenko</a>, who has ruled since 1994, reportedly disabled the internet <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/amp/belarus-lukashenka-internet-shutdown-protests/33211982.html\">during elections</a> earlier this year, following a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53753412\">similar move in 2020</a>. But they can also be more banal. Access Now documented countries disabling parts of the internet during <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/no-exam-shutdown/\">student exam periods</a> at least 16 times in 2024, including Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, and India.</p>\n<p>Iran&#8217;s shutdowns in <a href=\"https://ooni.org/post/2022-iran-technical-multistakeholder-report/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://filter.watch/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Irans-Stealth-Blackout-Report.pdf\">June</a> of this year are good examples of a highly sophisticated effort, with layers of shutdowns that end up forcing people off the global internet and onto Iran&#8217;s surveilled, censored national intranet. India, meanwhile, has been the world shutdown leader for many years, with 855 distinct incidents. Myanmar is second with 149, followed by Pakistan and then Iran. All of this information is available on Access Now&#8217;s <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zach.rosson/viz/STOP_v2/Dashboard1\">digital dashboard</a>, where you can see breakdowns by region, country, type, geographic extent, and time.</p>\n<p>There was a slight decline in shutdowns during the early years of the pandemic, but they have increased sharply since then. The reasons are varied, but a lot can be attributed to the rise in protest movements related to economic hardship and corruption, and general democratic backsliding and instability. In many countries today, shutdowns are a knee-jerk response to any form of unrest or protest, no matter how small.</p>\n<p>A country&#8217;s ability to shut down the internet depends a lot on its infrastructure. In the US, for example, shutdowns would be hard to enforce. As we saw when discussions about a <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/23/tik-tok-ban-us-congress-china/\">potential TikTok ban</a> ramped up two years ago, the complex and multifaceted nature of our internet makes it very difficult to achieve. However, as we&#8217;ve seen with total nationwide shutdowns around the world, the ripple effects in all aspects of life are immense. (Remember the effects of just a small outage&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr54m92ermgo\">CrowdStrike in 2024</a>&#8212;which crippled 8.5 million computers and cancelled 2,200 flights in the US alone?)</p>\n<p>The more centralized the internet infrastructure, the easier it is to implement a shutdown. If a country has just one cellphone provider, or only two fiber optic cables connecting the nation to the rest of the world, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240724-the-day-the-internet-turned-off\">shutting them down is easy</a>.</p>\n<p>Shutdowns are not only more common, but they&#8217;ve also become more harmful. Unlike in years past, when the internet was a nice option to have, or perhaps when internet penetration rates were significantly lower across the Global South, today the internet is an essential piece of societal infrastructure for the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/#:~:text=Number%20of%20internet%20and%20social,the%20number%20of%20internet%20users.\">majorit</a>y of the world&#8217;s population.</p>\n<p>Access Now has long maintained that denying people access to the internet is a human rights violation, and has collected harrowing stories from places like <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/15-stories-from-tigrays-internet-siege/\">Tigray</a> in Ethiopia, <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdown-stories-from-uganda/\">Uganda</a>, <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/shutdown-stories-annobon/\">Annobon</a> in Equatorial Guinea, and <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/how-internet-shutdowns-affect-women-in-iran/\">Iran</a>. The internet is an essential tool for a spectrum of rights, including freedom of expression and assembly. Shutdowns make <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Evading-accountability-through-internet-shutdowns.pdf\">documenting ongoing human rights abuses and atrocities</a> more difficult or impossible. They are also impactful on people&#8217;s daily lives, business, healthcare, education, finances, security, and safety, depending on the context. Shutdowns in conflict zones are particularly damaging, as they impact the ability of humanitarian actors to deliver aid and make it harder for people to find safe evacuation routes and civilian corridors.</p>\n<p>Defenses on the ground are slim. Depending on the country and the type of shutdown, there can be workarounds. Everything, from VPNs to mesh networks to Starlink terminals to foreign SIM cards near borders, has been used with varying degrees of success. The tech-savvy sometimes have other options. But for most everyone in society, no internet means no internet&#8212;and all the effects of that loss.</p>\n<p>The international community plays an important role in shaping how internet shutdowns are understood and addressed. World bodies <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/78/213\">have recognized</a> that reliable internet access is an essential service, and could put more pressure on governments to keep the internet on in conflict-affected areas. But while international condemnation has worked in some cases (<a href=\"https://www.channelstv.com/2024/11/02/mauritius-reverses-ban-on-social-media/\">Mauritius</a> and <a href=\"https://www.okayafrica.com/south-sudan-lifts-social-media-ban/270480\">South Sudan</a> are two recent examples), countries seem to be learning from each other, resulting in both more shutdowns and new countries perpetrating them.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still time to reverse the trend, if that&#8217;s what we want to do. Ultimately, the question comes down to whether or not governments will enshrine both a right to access information and freedom of expression in law and in practice. Keeping the internet on is a norm, but <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/five-years-later-the-internet-shutdown-that-rocked-egypt/\">the trajectory</a> from a single internet shutdown <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html\">in 2011</a> to <a href=\"http://accessnow.org/keepiton-data-dashboard\">2,000 blackouts</a> 15 years later demonstrates how embedded the practice has become.

It followed a more localized shutdown two weeks prior, reportedly instituted “to prevent immoral activities.” No additional explanation was given. The timing couldn’t have been worse: communities still reeling from a major earthquake lost emergency communications, flights were grounded, and banking was interrupted. Afghanistan’s blackout is part of a wider pattern. Just since the end of September, there were also major nationwide internet shutdowns in Tanzania and Cameroon, and significant regional shutdowns in Pakistan and Nigeria. In all cases but one, authorities offered no official justification or acknowledgment, leaving millions unable to access information, contact loved ones, or express themselves through moments of crisis, elections, and protests.\nThe frequency of deliberate internet shutdowns has skyrocketed since the first notable example in Egypt in 2011. Together with our colleagues at the digital rights organisation Access Now and the #KeepItOn coalition, we’ve tracked 296 deliberate internet shutdowns in 54 countries in 2024, and at least 244 more in 2025 so far.\nThis is more than an inconvenience. The internet has become an essential piece of infrastructure, affecting how we live, work, and get our information. It’s also a major enabler of human rights, and turning off the internet can worsen or conceal a spectrum of abuses. These shutdowns silence societies, and they’re getting more and more common.\nShutdowns can be local or national, partial or total. In total blackouts, like Afghanistan or Tanzania, nothing works. But shutdowns are often targeted more granularly. Cellphone internet could be blocked, but not broadband. Specific news sites, social media platforms, and messaging systems could be blocked, leaving overall network access unaffected—as when Brazil shut off X (formerly Twitter) in 2024. Sometimes bandwidth is just throttled, making everything slower and unreliable.\nSometimes, internet shutdowns are used in political or military operations. In recent years, Russia and Ukraine have shut off parts of each other’s internet, and Israel has repeatedly shut off Palestinians’ internet in Gaza. Shutdowns of this type happened 25 times in 2024, affecting people in 13 countries.\nReasons for the shutdowns are as varied as the countries that perpetrate them. General information control is just one. Shutdowns often come in response to political unrest, as governments try to prevent people from organizing and getting information; Panama had a regional shutdown this summer in response to protests. Or during elections, as opposition parties utilize the internet to mobilize supporters and communicate strategy. Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenko, who has ruled since 1994, reportedly disabled the internet during elections earlier this year, following a similar move in 2020. But they can also be more banal. Access Now documented countries disabling parts of the internet during student exam periods at least 16 times in 2024, including Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, and India.\nIran’s shutdowns in 2022 and June of this year are good examples of a highly sophisticated effort, with layers of shutdowns that end up forcing people off the global internet and onto Iran’s surveilled, censored national intranet. India, meanwhile, has been the world shutdown leader for many years, with 855 distinct incidents. Myanmar is second with 149, followed by Pakistan and then Iran. All of this information is available on Access Now’s digital dashboard, where you can see breakdowns by region, country, type, geographic extent, and time.\nThere was a slight decline in shutdowns during the early years of the pandemic, but they have increased sharply since then. The reasons are varied, but a lot can be attributed to the rise in protest movements related to economic hardship and corruption, and general democratic backsliding and instability. In many countries today, shutdowns are a knee-jerk response to any form of unrest or protest, no matter how small.\nA country’s ability to shut down the internet depends a lot on its infrastructure. In the US, for example, shutdowns would be hard to enforce. As we saw when discussions about a potential TikTok ban ramped up two years ago, the complex and multifaceted nature of our internet makes it very difficult to achieve. However, as we’ve seen with total nationwide shutdowns around the world, the ripple effects in all aspects of life are immense. (Remember the effects of just a small outage—CrowdStrike in 2024—which crippled 8.5 million computers and cancelled 2,200 flights in the US alone?)\nThe more centralized the internet infrastructure, the easier it is to implement a shutdown. If a country has just one cellphone provider, or only two fiber optic cables connecting the nation to the rest of the world, shutting them down is easy.\nShutdowns are not only more common, but they’ve also become more harmful. Unlike in years past, when the internet was a nice option to have, or perhaps when internet penetration rates were significantly lower across the Global South, today the internet is an essential piece of societal infrastructure for the majority of the world’s population.\nAccess Now has long maintained that denying people access to the internet is a human rights violation, and has collected harrowing stories from places like Tigray in Ethiopia, Uganda, Annobon in Equatorial Guinea, and Iran. The internet is an essential tool for a spectrum of rights, including freedom of expression and assembly. Shutdowns make documenting ongoing human rights abuses and atrocities more difficult or impossible. They are also impactful on people’s daily lives, business, healthcare, education, finances, security, and safety, depending on the context. Shutdowns in conflict zones are particularly damaging, as they impact the ability of humanitarian actors to deliver aid and make it harder for people to find safe evacuation routes and civilian corridors.\nDefenses on the ground are slim. Depending on the country and the type of shutdown, there can be workarounds. Everything, from VPNs to mesh networks to Starlink terminals to foreign SIM cards near borders, has been used with varying degrees of success. The tech-savvy sometimes have other options. But for most everyone in society, no internet means no internet—and all the effects of that loss.\nThe international community plays an important role in shaping how internet shutdowns are understood and addressed. World bodies have recognized that reliable internet access is an essential service, and could put more pressure on governments to keep the internet on in conflict-affected areas. But while international condemnation has worked in some cases (Mauritius and South Sudan are two recent examples), countries seem to be learning from each other, resulting in both more shutdowns and new countries perpetrating them.\nThere’s still time to reverse the trend, if that’s what we want to do. Ultimately, the question comes down to whether or not governments will enshrine both a right to access information and freedom of expression in law and in practice. Keeping the internet on is a norm, but the trajectory from a single internet shutdown in 2011 to 2,000 blackouts 15 years later demonstrates how embedded the practice has become. The implications of that shift are still unfolding, but they reach far beyond the moment the screen goes dark.\nThis essay was written with Zach Rosson, and originally appeared in Gizmodo.",

Image: Infoblox.</p></div>\n<p>When Internet users try to visit expired domain names or accidentally navigate to a lookalike &#8220;typosquatting&#8221; domain, they are typically brought to a placeholder page at a domain parking company that tries to monetize the wayward traffic by displaying links to a number of third-party websites that have paid to have their links shown.</p>\n<p>A decade ago, ending up at one of these parked domains came with a relatively small chance of being redirected to a malicious destination: In 2014, researchers <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-alrwais.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> (PDF) that parked domains redirected users to malicious sites less than five percent of the time &#8212; regardless of whether the visitor clicked on any links at the parked page.</p>\n<p>But in a series of experiments over the past few months, researchers at the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> say they discovered the situation is now reversed, and that malicious content is by far the norm now for parked websites.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;In large scale experiments, we found that over 90% of the time, visitors to a parked domain would be directed to illegal content, scams, scareware and anti-virus software subscriptions, or malware, as the &#8216;click&#8217; was sold from the parking company to advertisers, who often resold that traffic to yet another party,&#8221; Infoblox researchers wrote in <a href=\"https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/parked-domains-become-weapons-with-direct-search-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a paper published today</a>.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found parked websites are benign if the visitor arrives at the site using a virtual private network (VPN), or else via a non-residential Internet address. For example, <strong>Scotiabank.com</strong> customers who accidentally mistype the domain as <strong>scotaibank[.]com</strong> will see a normal parking page if they&#8217;re using a VPN, but will be redirected to a site that tries to foist scams, malware or other unwanted content if coming from a residential IP address. Again, this redirect happens just by visiting the misspelled domain with a mobile device or desktop computer that is using a residential IP address.</p>\n<p>According to Infoblox, the person or entity that owns scotaibank[.]com has a portfolio of nearly 3,000 lookalike domains, including <strong>gmai[.]com</strong>, which demonstrably has been configured with its own mail server for accepting incoming email messages. Meaning, if you send an email to a Gmail user and accidentally omit the &#8220;l&#8221; from &#8220;gmail.com,&#8221; that missive doesn&#8217;t just disappear into the ether or produce a bounce reply: It goes straight to these scammers. The report notices this domain also has been leveraged in multiple recent business email compromise campaigns, using a lure indicating a failed payment with trojan malware attached.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found this particular domain holder (betrayed by a common DNS server &#8212; torresdns[.]com) has set up typosquatting domains targeting dozens of top Internet destinations, including <strong>Craigslist</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Wikipedia</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, <strong>TripAdvisor</strong>, <strong>Yahoo</strong>, <strong>eBay</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft</strong>. A defanged list of these typosquatting domains is <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/torresdns.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available here</a> (the dots in the listed domains have been replaced with commas).<span id=\"more-72848\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>David Brunsdon</strong>, a threat researcher at Infoblox, said the parked pages send visitors through a chain of redirects, all while profiling the visitor&#8217;s system using IP geolocation, device fingerprinting, and cookies to determine where to redirect domain visitors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was often a chain of redirects &#8212; one or two domains outside the parking company &#8212; before threat arrives,&#8221; Brunsdon said. &#8220;Each time in the handoff the device is profiled again and again, before being passed off to a malicious domain or else a decoy page like Amazon.com or Alibaba.com if they decide it&#8217;s not worth targeting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brunsdon said domain parking services claim the search results they return on parked pages are designed to be relevant to their parked domains, but that almost none of this displayed content was related to the lookalike domain names they tested.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72862\" style=\"width: 757px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/scotaibank.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72862\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72862\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/scotaibank.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"747\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/scotaibank.png 990w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/scotaibank-768x408.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/scotaibank-782x415.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72862\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samples of redirection paths when visiting scotaibank dot com.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Direct navigation — the act of visiting a website by manually typing a domain name in a web browser — has never been riskier: A new study finds the vast majority of “parked” domains — mostly expired or dormant domain names, or common misspellings of popular websites — are now configured to redirect visitors to sites that foist scams and malware.\n\nA lookalike domain to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center website, returned a non-threatening parking page (left) whereas a mobile user was instantly directed to deceptive content in October 2025 (right). Image: Infoblox.\n\nWhen Internet users try to visit expired domain names or accidentally navigate to a lookalike “typosquatting” domain, they are typically brought to a placeholder page at a domain parking company that tries to monetize the wayward traffic by displaying links to a number of third-party websites that have paid to have their links shown.\nA decade ago, ending up at one of these parked domains came with a relatively small chance of being redirected to a malicious destination: In 2014, researchers found (PDF) that parked domains redirected users to malicious sites less than five percent of the time — regardless of whether the visitor clicked on any links at the parked page.\nBut in a series of experiments over the past few months, researchers at the security firm Infoblox say they discovered the situation is now reversed, and that malicious content is by far the norm now for parked websites.\n“In large scale experiments, we found that over 90% of the time, visitors to a parked domain would be directed to illegal content, scams, scareware and anti-virus software subscriptions, or malware, as the ‘click’ was sold from the parking company to advertisers, who often resold that traffic to yet another party,” Infoblox researchers wrote in a paper published today.\nInfoblox found parked websites are benign if the visitor arrives at the site using a virtual private network (VPN), or else via a non-residential Internet address. For example, Scotiabank.com customers who accidentally mistype the domain as scotaibank[.]com will see a normal parking page if they’re using a VPN, but will be redirected to a site that tries to foist scams, malware or other unwanted content if coming from a residential IP address. Again, this redirect happens just by visiting the misspelled domain with a mobile device or desktop computer that is using a residential IP address.\nAccording to Infoblox, the person or entity that owns scotaibank[.]com has a portfolio of nearly 3,000 lookalike domains, including gmai[.]com, which demonstrably has been configured with its own mail server for accepting incoming email messages. Meaning, if you send an email to a Gmail user and accidentally omit the “l” from “gmail.com,” that missive doesn’t just disappear into the ether or produce a bounce reply: It goes straight to these scammers. The report notices this domain also has been leveraged in multiple recent business email compromise campaigns, using a lure indicating a failed payment with trojan malware attached.\nInfoblox found this particular domain holder (betrayed by a common DNS server — torresdns[.]com) has set up typosquatting domains targeting dozens of top Internet destinations, including Craigslist, YouTube, Google, Wikipedia, Netflix, TripAdvisor, Yahoo, eBay, and Microsoft. A defanged list of these typosquatting domains is available here (the dots in the listed domains have been replaced with commas).\nDavid Brunsdon, a threat researcher at Infoblox, said the parked pages send visitors through a chain of redirects, all while profiling the visitor’s system using IP geolocation, device fingerprinting, and cookies to determine where to redirect domain visitors.\n“It was often a chain of redirects — one or two domains outside the parking company — before threat arrives,” Brunsdon said. “Each time in the handoff the device is profiled again and again, before being passed off to a malicious domain or else a decoy page like Amazon.com or Alibaba.com if they decide it’s not worth targeting.”\nBrunsdon said domain parking services claim the search results they return on parked pages are designed to be relevant to their parked domains, but that almost none of this displayed content was related to the lookalike domain names they tested.\n\nSamples of redirection paths when visiting scotaibank dot com. Each branch includes a series of domains observed, including the color-coded landing page.

In recent months, however, Infoblox discovered the malicious redirect only happens when the query for the misconfigured domain comes from a visitor who is using Cloudflare’s DNS resolvers (1.1.1.1), and that all other visitors will get a page that refuses to load.\nThe researchers found that even variations on well-known government domains are being targeted by malicious ad networks.\n“When one of our researchers tried to report a crime to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), they accidentally visited ic3[.]org instead of ic3[.]gov,” the report notes. “Their phone was quickly redirected to a false ‘Drive Subscription Expired’ page. They were lucky to receive a scam; based on what we’ve learnt, they could just as easily receive an information stealer or trojan malware.”\nThe Infoblox report emphasizes that the malicious activity they tracked is not attributed to any known party, noting that the domain parking or advertising platforms named in the study were not implicated in the malvertising they documented.\nHowever, the report concludes that while the parking companies claim to only work with top advertisers, the traffic to these domains was frequently sold to affiliate networks, who often resold the traffic to the point where the final advertiser had no business relationship with the parking companies.\nInfoblox also pointed out that recent policy changes by Google may have inadvertently increased the risk to users from direct search abuse.
