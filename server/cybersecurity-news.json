The Trump White House has aggressively adopted AI-generated <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/white-house-social-media-2025-memes-ai-maga-messaging-rcna220152\">memes</a> in its online messaging strategy. The administration has also used <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/preventing-woke-ai-in-the-federal-government/\">executive orders</a> and federal buying power to influence the development and encoded values of AI technologies away from &#8220;woke&#8221; ideology. Going further, Trump ally Elon Musk has shaped his own AI company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/technology/elon-musk-grok-conservative-chatbot.html\">Grok</a> models in his own ideological image. These actions appear to be part of a larger, ongoing Big Tech industry <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jd-vance-silicon-valley-support/\">realignment</a> towards the political will, and perhaps also the values, of the Republican party.</p>\n<p>Democrats, as the party out of power, are in a largely reactive posture on AI. A large bloc of Congressional Democrats responded to Trump administration actions in April by <a href=\"https://beyer.house.gov/uploadedfiles/congressional_letter_to_administration_on_doge_use_of_ai.pdf\">arguing against</a> their adoption of AI in government. Their letter to the Trump administration&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget provided detailed criticisms and questions about DOGE&#8217;s behaviors and called for a halt to DOGE&#8217;s use of AI, but also said that they &#8220;support implementation of AI technologies in a manner that complies with existing&#8221; laws. It was a perfectly reasonable, if nuanced, position, and illustrates how the actions of one party can dictate the political positioning of the opposing party.</p>\n<p>These shifts are driven more by political dynamics than by ideology. Big Tech CEOs&#8217; deference to the Trump administration seems largely an effort to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-33-silicon-valley-power-144226245.html\">curry favor</a>, while Silicon Valley continues to be represented by <a href=\"https://khanna.house.gov/media/in-the-news/silicon-valleys-khanna-top-scholars-being-ignored-ai-debate\">tech-forward</a> Democrat Ro Khanna. And a June <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/ai-impact-on-people-society-appendix/\">Pew Research</a> poll shows nearly identical levels of concern by Democrats and Republicans about the increasing use of AI in America.</p>\n<p>There are, arguably, natural positions each party would be expected to take on AI. An April House subcommittee <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/artificial-intelligence-examining-trends-innovation-and-competition-0\">hearing</a> on AI trends in innovation and competition revealed much about that equilibrium. Following the lead of the Trump administration, Republicans cast doubt on any <a href=\"https://fedscoop.com/house-republicans-regulatory-approach-ai-trump/\">regulation</a> of the AI industry. Democrats, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/antitrust-subcommittee-ranking-member-nadler-s-opening-statement-at-hearing-on-artificial-intelligence-innovation-and-competition\">emphasized</a> consumer protection and resisting a concentration of corporate power. Notwithstanding the <a href=\"https://robertreich.substack.com/p/the-corporate-democrats-biggest-nightmare\">fluctuating dominance</a> of the corporate wing of the Democratic party and the volatile populism of Trump, this reflects the parties&#8217; historical positions on technology.</p>\n<p>While Republicans focus on cozying up to tech plutocrats and removing the barriers around their business models, Democrats could revive the 2020 messaging of candidates like <a href=\"https://2020.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/\">Andrew Yang</a> and <a href=\"https://2020.elizabethwarren.com/toolkit/umt\">Elizabeth Warren</a>. They could paint an alternative vision of the future where Big Tech companies&#8217; profits and billionaires&#8217; wealth are taxed and redistributed to young people facing an affordability crisis for housing, healthcare, and other essentials.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Democrats could use the technology to demonstrably show a commitment to participatory democracy. They could use AI-driven <a href=\"https://proceedings.open.tudelft.nl/DGO2025/article/view/953\">collaborative policymaking</a> tools like <a href=\"https://decidim.org\">Decidim</a>, <a href=\"http://pol.is\">Pol.Is</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.govocal.com\">Go Vocal</a> to collect voter input on a massive scale and align their platform to the public interest.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s surprising how little these kinds of sensemaking tools are being adopted by candidates and parties today. Instead of using AI to capture and learn from constituent input, candidates more often seem to think of AI as just another broadcast technology&#8212;good only for getting their likeness and message in front of people. A case in point: British Member of Parliament Mark Sewards, presumably acting in good faith, recently attracted <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/06/ai-chatbot-mp-britain-labour/\">scorn</a> after releasing a vacuous AI avatar of himself to his constituents.</p>\n<p>Where the political polarization of AI goes next will probably depend on unpredictable future events and how partisans opportunistically seize on them.
