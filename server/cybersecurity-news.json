Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called <strong>Aisuru</strong> that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.</p>\n<p>In October, it appeared the cybercriminals in control of Aisuru had shifted the botnet&#8217;s focus from DDoS to a more sustainable and profitable use: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic</a>.</p>\n<p>However, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as <strong>Kimwolf</strong>. Chinese security firm <strong>XLab, </strong>which was the first to chronicle Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024, <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/kimwolf-botnet-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently profiled Kimwolf</a> as easily the world&#8217;s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines &#8212; with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.</p>\n<p>XLab noted that the Kimwolf author &#8220;shows an almost &#8216;obsessive&#8217; fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72917\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72917\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-72917\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip.png 783w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip-768x664.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72917\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: XLab, Kimwolf Botnet Exposed: The Massive Android Botnet with 1.8 million infected devices.</p></div>\n<p>I am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet&#8217;s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "KrebsOnSecurity.com celebrates its 16th anniversary today! A huge “thank you” to all of our readers — newcomers, long-timers and drive-by critics alike. Your engagement this past year here has been tremendous and truly a salve on a handful of dark days. Happily, comeuppance was a strong theme running through our coverage in 2025, with a primary focus on entities that enabled complex and globally-dispersed cybercrime services.\n\nImage: Shutterstock, Younes Stiller Kraske.\n\nIn May 2024, we scrutinized the history and ownership of Stark Industries Solutions Ltd., a “bulletproof hosting” provider that came online just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and served as a primary staging ground for repeated Kremlin cyberattacks and disinformation efforts. A year later, Stark and its two co-owners were sanctioned by the European Union, but our analysis showed those penalties have done little to stop the Stark proprietors from rebranding and transferring considerable network assets to other entities they control.\nIn December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity profiled Cryptomus, a financial firm registered in Canada that emerged as the payment processor of choice for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers. In October 2025, Canadian financial regulators ruled that Cryptomus had grossly violated its anti-money laundering laws, and levied a record $176 million fine against the platform.\n\nIn September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service LastPass in 2022. In a court filing in March 2025, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.\nPhishing was a major theme of this year’s coverage, which peered inside the day-to-day operations of several voice phishing gangs that routinely carried out elaborate, convincing, and financially devastating cryptocurrency thefts. A Day in the Life of a Prolific Voice Phishing Crew examined how one cybercrime gang abused legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.\nNearly a half-dozen stories in 2025 dissected the incessant SMS phishing or “smishing” coming from China-based phishing kit vendors, who make it easy for customers to convert phished payment card data into mobile wallets from Apple and Google. In an effort to wrest control over this phishing syndicate’s online resources, Google has since filed at least two John Doe lawsuits targeting these groups and dozens of unnamed defendants.\nIn January, we highlighted research into a dodgy and sprawling content delivery network called Funnull that specialized in helping China-based gambling and money laundering websites distribute their operations across multiple U.S.-based cloud providers. Five months later, the U.S. government sanctioned Funnull, identifying it as a top source of investment/romance scams known as “pig butchering.”\n\nImage: Shutterstock, ArtHead.\n\nIn May, Pakistan arrested 21 people alleged to be working for Heartsender, a phishing and malware dissemination service that KrebsOnSecurity first profiled back in 2015. The arrests came shortly after the FBI and the Dutch police seized dozens of servers and domains for the group. Many of those arrested were first publicly identified in a 2021 story here about how they’d inadvertently infected their computers with malware that gave away their real-life identities.\nIn April, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted the proprietors of a Pakistan-based e-commerce company for conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States. The following month, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how the proprietors of the sanctioned entity are perhaps better known for operating an elaborate and lengthy scheme to scam westerners seeking help with trademarks, book writing, mobile app development and logo designs.\nEarlier this month, we examined an academic cheating empire turbocharged by Google Ads that earned tens of millions of dollars in revenue and has curious ties to a Kremlin-connected oligarch whose Russian university builds drones for Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nAn attack drone advertised on a website hosted in the same network as Russia’s largest private education company — Synergy University.\n\nAs ever, KrebsOnSecurity endeavored to keep close tabs on the world’s biggest and most disruptive botnets, which pummeled the Internet this year with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults that were two to three times the size and impact of previous record DDoS attacks.\nIn June, KrebsOnSecurity.com was hit by the largest DDoS attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time (we are a grateful guest of Google’s excellent Project Shield offering). Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called Aisuru that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.\nIn October, it appeared the cybercriminals in control of Aisuru had shifted the botnet’s focus from DDoS to a more sustainable and profitable use: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic.\nHowever, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as Kimwolf. Chinese security firm XLab, which was the first to chronicle Aisuru’s rise in 2024, recently profiled Kimwolf as easily the world’s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines — with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.\nXLab noted that the Kimwolf author “shows an almost ‘obsessive’ fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.”\n\nImage: XLab, Kimwolf Botnet Exposed: The Massive Android Botnet with 1.8 million infected devices.\n\nI am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet’s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide. The first in that series will include a somewhat sobering and global security notification concerning the devices and residential proxy services that are inadvertently helping to power Kimwolf’s rapid growth.\nThank you once again for your continued readership, encouragement and support.

The technologies of artificial intelligence are <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/?ref=merionwest.com\">already pervading</a> many aspects of democratic government, affecting our lives in ways both large and small. This has occurred largely without our notice or consent. The result is a government incrementally transformed by AI rather than the singular technological overlord of the big screen.</p>\n<p>Let us begin with the executive branch. One of the most important functions of this branch of government is to administer the law, including the human services on which so many Americans rely. Many of these programs have long been operated by a mix of humans and machines, even if not previously using modern AI tools such as <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models?ref=merionwest.com\">Large Language Models</a>.</p>\n<p>A salient example is healthcare, where private insurers make widespread use of algorithms to review, approve, and deny coverage, even for recipients of public benefits like Medicare.

This month, the Trump administration took a step further. CMS rolled out an aggressive <a href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-wiser-model-aims-to-leverage-ai-7821543/?ref=merionwest.com\">new program</a> that financially rewards vendors that leverage AI to reject rapidly prior authorization for &quot;wasteful&quot; physician or provider-requested medical services. The same month, the Trump administration also issued an e<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/?ref=merionwest.com\">xecutive order</a> limiting the abilities of states to put consumer and patient protections around the use of AI.</p>\n<p>This shows both growing confidence in AI&#8217;s efficiency and a deliberate choice to benefit from it without restricting its possible harms. <a href=\"https://schrier.house.gov/media/in-the-news/democrats-introduce-legislation-block-wiseer-prior-authorization-model?ref=merionwest.com\">Critics</a> of the CMS program have characterized it as effectively establishing a bounty on denying care; AI&#8212;in this case&#8212;is being used to serve a ministerial function in applying that policy. But AI could equally be used to automate a different policy objective, such as minimizing the time required to approve pre-authorizations for necessary services or to minimize the effort required of providers to achieve authorization.</p>\n<p>Next up is the judiciary. Setting aside concerns about activist judges and court overreach, jurists are not supposed to decide what law is. The function of judges and courts is to interpret the law written by others. Just as jurists have long turned to dictionaries and expert witnesses for assistance in their interpretation, AI has already emerged as a tool used by judges to infer legislative intent and decide on cases. In 2023, a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/judge-used-chatgpt-to-make-court-decision/?ref=merionwest.com\">Colombian</a> judge was the first publicly to use AI to help make a ruling. The first known American federal example came a year later when United States Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom began <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-judge-runs-mini-experiment-with-ai-help-decide-case-2024-09-06/?ref=merionwest.com\">using</a> AI in his jurisprudence, to provide second &quot;opinions&quot; on the plain language meaning of words in statute. A <a href=\"https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/alerts/2025/february/27/client-alert-ai-enters-the-courtroom?ref=merionwest.com\">District of Columbia Court of Appeals</a> similarly used ChatGPT in 2025 to deliver an interpretation of what common knowledge is. And there are more examples from <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/judges-and-magistrates-in-peru-and-mexico-have-chatgpt-fever/?ref=merionwest.com\">Latin America</a>, the United Kingdom, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/india-court-chatgpt-bail-murder-case/?ref=merionwest.com\">India</a>, and beyond.</p>\n<p>Given that these examples are likely merely the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/12/british-judges-using-ai/?ref=merionwest.com\">tip of the iceberg</a>, it is also important to remember that any judge can unilaterally choose to consult an AI while drafting his opinions, just as he may choose to consult other human beings, and a judge may be under no obligation to disclose when he does.</p>\n<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing. AI has the ability to replace humans but also to augment human capabilities, which may significantly expand human agency. Whether the results are good or otherwise depends on many factors. These include the application and its situation, the characteristics and performance of the AI model, and the characteristics and performance of the humans it augments or replaces. This general model applies to the use of AI in the judiciary.</p>\n<p>Each application of AI legitimately needs to be considered in its own context, but certain principles should apply in all uses of AI in democratic contexts. First and foremost, we argue, AI should be applied in ways that decentralize rather than concentrate power. It should be used to empower individual human actors rather than automating the decision-making of a central authority. We are open to independent judges selecting and leveraging AI models as tools in their own jurisprudence, but we remain concerned about Big Tech companies building and operating a dominant AI product that becomes widely used throughout the judiciary.</p>\n<p>This principle brings us to the legislature. Policymakers worldwide are already using AI in many aspects of lawmaking. In 2023, the first law written entirely by AI was passed in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-artificial-intelligence-porto-alegre-5afd1240afe7b6ac202bb0bbc45e08d4?ref=merionwest.com\">Brazil</a>. Within a year, the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16182?ref=merionwest.com\">French</a> government had produced its own AI model tailored to help the Parliament with the consideration of amendments. By the end of that year, the use of AI in legislative offices had become widespread enough that twenty percent of state-level staffers in the United States <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/center-for-legislative-strengthening/legislative-use-of-artificial-intelligence-2024-survey?ref=merionwest.com\">reported</a> using it, and another forty percent were considering it.</p>\n<p>These legislative members and staffers, collectively, face a significant choice: to wield AI in a way that concentrates or distributes power. If legislative offices use AI primarily to encode the policy prescriptions of party leadership or powerful interest groups, then they will effectively cede their own power to those central authorities. AI here serves only as a tool enabling that handover.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if legislative offices use AI to amplify their capacity to express and advocate for the policy positions of their principals&#8212;the elected representatives&#8212;they can strengthen their role in government. Additionally, AI can help them scale their ability to listen to many voices and synthesize input from their constituents, making it a powerful tool for better realizing democracy. We may prefer a legislator who translates his principles into the technical components and legislative language of bills with the aid of a <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/2023/06/10315786/1S2UvzHqRZC?ref=merionwest.com\">trustworthy AI</a> tool executing under his exclusive control rather than with the aid of lobbyists executing under the control of a corporate patron.</p>\n<p>Examples from around the globe demonstrate how legislatures can use AI as tools for tapping into constituent feedback to drive policymaking.
