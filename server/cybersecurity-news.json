    "content:encoded": "<p>Our <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first story of 2026</a> revealed how a destructive new botnet called <strong>Kimwolf</strong> has infected more than two million devices by mass-compromising a vast number of unofficial <strong>Android TV streaming boxes</strong>. Today, we&#8217;ll dig through digital clues left behind by the hackers, network operators and services that appear to have benefitted from Kimwolf&#8217;s spread.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 17, 2025, the Chinese security firm <strong>XLab</strong> published <a href=\"jsalton@keepersecurity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a deep dive on Kimwolf</a>, which forces infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay abusive and malicious Internet traffic for so-called &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; services.</p>\n<p>The software that turns one&#8217;s device into a residential proxy is often quietly bundled with mobile apps and games. Kimwolf specifically targeted residential proxy software that is factory installed on <a href=\"https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than a thousand different models</a> of unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices. Very quickly, the residential proxy&#8217;s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping.</p>\n<p>The XLab report explained its researchers found &#8220;definitive evidence&#8221; that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the <strong>Aisuru botnet </strong>&#8212; an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services.</p>\n<p>XLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at <strong>93.95.112[.]59</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73024\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73024\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-73024\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/XLab-resito.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"661\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73024\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: XLab.</p></div>\n<h2>RESI RACK</h2>\n<p>Public records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based <strong>Resi Rack LLC</strong>. Resi Rack&#8217;s website bills the company as a &#8220;Premium Game Server Hosting Provider.&#8221; Meanwhile, Resi Rack&#8217;s ads on the Internet moneymaking forum <strong>BlackHatWorld</strong> refer to it as a &#8220;Premium Residential Proxy Hosting and Proxy Software Solutions Company.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Resi Rack co-founder <strong>Cassidy Hales</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity his company received a notification on December 10 about Kimwolf using their network &#8220;that detailed what was being done by one of our customers leasing our servers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we received this email we took care of this issue immediately,&#8221; Hales wrote in response to an email requesting comment. &#8220;This is something we are very disappointed is now associated with our name and this was not the intention of our company whatsoever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Resi Rack Internet address cited by XLab on December 8 came onto KrebsOnSecurity&#8217;s radar more than two weeks before that. <strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\"https://synthient.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Synthient</a>, a startup that tracks proxy services. In late October 2025, Brundage shared that the people selling various proxy services which benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets were doing so at a new Discord server called <strong>resi[.]to</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73004\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-93-95-112-53.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73004\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-73004\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-93-95-112-53.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-93-95-112-53.png 1074w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-93-95-112-53-768x518.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-93-95-112-53-782x528.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73004\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">On November 24, 2025, a member of the resi-dot-to Discord channel shares an IP address responsible for proxying traffic over Android TV streaming boxes infected by the Kimwolf botnet.</p></div>\n<p>When KrebsOnSecurity joined the resi[.]to Discord channel in late October as a silent lurker, the server had fewer than 150 members, including &#8220;<strong>Shox</strong>&#8221; &#8212; the nickname used by Resi Rack&#8217;s co-founder Mr. Hales &#8212; and his business partner &#8220;<strong>Linus</strong>,&#8221; who did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Other members of the resi[.]to Discord channel would periodically <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-hackerpakistan.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post new IP addresses</a> that were responsible for proxying traffic over the Kimwolf botnet. As the screenshot from resi[.]to above shows, that Resi Rack Internet address flagged by XLab was used by Kimwolf to direct proxy traffic as far back as November 24, if not earlier. All told, Synthient said it tracked at least seven static Resi Rack IP addresses connected to Kimwolf proxy infrastructure between October and December 2025.</p>\n<p>Neither of Resi Rack&#8217;s co-owners responded to follow-up questions. Both have been active in selling proxy services via Discord for nearly two years. According to a review of Discord messages indexed by the cyber intelligence firm <strong>Flashpoint</strong>, Shox and Linus spent much of 2024 selling static &#8220;ISP proxies&#8221; by routing various Internet address blocks at major U.S. Internet service providers.</p>\n<p>In February 2025, AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://serviceguidenew.att.com/sg_CustomPreviewer?attachmentId=00PPV00001Jf2Qf2AJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that effective July 31, 2025, it would no longer originate routes for network blocks that are not owned and managed by AT&amp;T (other major ISPs have since made similar moves). Less than a month later, Shox and Linus told customers they would soon cease offering static ISP proxies as a result of these policy changes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73006\" style=\"width: 529px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73006\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73006\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shox-linus-static-att.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"519\" height=\"537\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shox and Linux, talking about their decision to stop selling ISP proxies.</p></div>\n<h2>DORT &amp; SNOW</h2>\n<p>The stated owner of the resi[.]to Discord server went by the abbreviated username &#8220;D.&#8221; That initial appears to be short for the hacker handle &#8220;<strong>Dort</strong>,&#8221; a name that was invoked frequently throughout these Discord chats.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73003\" style=\"width: 617px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73003\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73003\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-d-profile.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"765\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73003\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dort&#8217;s profile on resi dot to.</p></div>\n<p>This &#8220;Dort&#8221; nickname came up in KrebsOnSecurity&#8217;s recent conversations with &#8220;<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/forky/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Forky</strong></a>,&#8221; a Brazilian man who <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acknowledged</a> being involved in the marketing of the Aisuru botnet at its inception in late 2024.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Our first story of 2026 revealed how a destructive new botnet called Kimwolf has infected more than two million devices by mass-compromising a vast number of unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. Today, we’ll dig through digital clues left behind by the hackers, network operators and services that appear to have benefitted from Kimwolf’s spread.\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, the Chinese security firm XLab published a deep dive on Kimwolf, which forces infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay abusive and malicious Internet traffic for so-called “residential proxy” services.\nThe software that turns one’s device into a residential proxy is often quietly bundled with mobile apps and games. Kimwolf specifically targeted residential proxy software that is factory installed on more than a thousand different models of unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices. Very quickly, the residential proxy’s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping.\nThe XLab report explained its researchers found “definitive evidence” that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the Aisuru botnet — an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services.\nXLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at 93.95.112[.]59.\n\nImage: XLab.\n\nRESI RACK\nPublic records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based Resi Rack LLC. Resi Rack’s website bills the company as a “Premium Game Server Hosting Provider.” Meanwhile, Resi Rack’s ads on the Internet moneymaking forum BlackHatWorld refer to it as a “Premium Residential Proxy Hosting and Proxy Software Solutions Company.”\nResi Rack co-founder Cassidy Hales told KrebsOnSecurity his company received a notification on December 10 about Kimwolf using their network “that detailed what was being done by one of our customers leasing our servers.”\n“When we received this email we took care of this issue immediately,” Hales wrote in response to an email requesting comment. “This is something we are very disappointed is now associated with our name and this was not the intention of our company whatsoever.”\nThe Resi Rack Internet address cited by XLab on December 8 came onto KrebsOnSecurity’s radar more than two weeks before that. Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services. In late October 2025, Brundage shared that the people selling various proxy services which benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets were doing so at a new Discord server called resi[.]to.\n\nOn November 24, 2025, a member of the resi-dot-to Discord channel shares an IP address responsible for proxying traffic over Android TV streaming boxes infected by the Kimwolf botnet.\n\nWhen KrebsOnSecurity joined the resi[.]to Discord channel in late October as a silent lurker, the server had fewer than 150 members, including “Shox” — the nickname used by Resi Rack’s co-founder Mr. Hales — and his business partner “Linus,” who did not respond to requests for comment.\nOther members of the resi[.]to Discord channel would periodically post new IP addresses that were responsible for proxying traffic over the Kimwolf botnet. As the screenshot from resi[.]to above shows, that Resi Rack Internet address flagged by XLab was used by Kimwolf to direct proxy traffic as far back as November 24, if not earlier. All told, Synthient said it tracked at least seven static Resi Rack IP addresses connected to Kimwolf proxy infrastructure between October and December 2025.\nNeither of Resi Rack’s co-owners responded to follow-up questions. Both have been active in selling proxy services via Discord for nearly two years. According to a review of Discord messages indexed by the cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, Shox and Linus spent much of 2024 selling static “ISP proxies” by routing various Internet address blocks at major U.S. Internet service providers.\nIn February 2025, AT&T announced that effective July 31, 2025, it would no longer originate routes for network blocks that are not owned and managed by AT&T (other major ISPs have since made similar moves). Less than a month later, Shox and Linus told customers they would soon cease offering static ISP proxies as a result of these policy changes.\n\nShox and Linux, talking about their decision to stop selling ISP proxies.\n\nDORT & SNOW\nThe stated owner of the resi[.]to Discord server went by the abbreviated username “D.” That initial appears to be short for the hacker handle “Dort,” a name that was invoked frequently throughout these Discord chats.\n\nDort’s profile on resi dot to.\n\nThis “Dort” nickname came up in KrebsOnSecurity’s recent conversations with “Forky,” a Brazilian man who acknowledged being involved in the marketing of the Aisuru botnet at its inception in late 2024. But Forky vehemently denied having anything to do with a series of massive and record-smashing DDoS attacks in the latter half of 2025 that were blamed on Aisuru, saying the botnet by that point had been taken over by rivals.\nForky asserts that Dort is a resident of Canada and one of at least two individuals currently in control of the Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet. The other individual Forky named as an Aisuru/Kimwolf botmaster goes by the nickname “Snow.”\nOn January 2 — just hours after our story on Kimwolf was published — the historical chat records on resi[.]to were erased without warning and replaced by a profanity-laced message for Synthient’s founder. Minutes after that, the entire server disappeared.\nLater that same day, several of the more active members of the now-defunct resi[.]to Discord server moved to a Telegram channel where they posted Brundage’s personal information, and generally complained about being unable to find reliable “bulletproof” hosting for their botnet.\nHilariously, a user by the name “Richard Remington” briefly appeared in the group’s Telegram server to post a crude “Happy New Year” sketch that claims Dort and Snow are now in control of 3.5 million devices infected by Aisuru and/or Kimwolf. Richard Remington’s Telegram account has since been deleted, but it previously stated its owner operates a website that caters to DDoS-for-hire or “stresser” services seeking to test their firepower.\n\nBYTECONNECT, PLAINPROXIES, AND 3XK TECH\nReports from both Synthient and XLab found that Kimwolf was used to deploy programs that turned infected systems into Internet traffic relays for multiple residential proxy services. Among those was a component that installed a software development kit (SDK) called ByteConnect, which is distributed by a provider known as Plainproxies.\nByteConnect says it specializes in “monetizing apps ethically and free,” while Plainproxies advertises the ability to provide content scraping companies with “unlimited” proxy pools. However, Synthient said that upon connecting to ByteConnect’s SDK they instead observed a mass influx of credential-stuffing attacks targeting email servers and popular online websites.\nA search on LinkedIn finds the CEO of Plainproxies is Friedrich Kraft, whose resume says he is co-founder of ByteConnect Ltd. Public Internet routing records show Mr. Kraft also operates a hosting firm in Germany called 3XK Tech GmbH. Mr. Kraft did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.\nIn July 2025, Cloudflare reported that 3XK Tech (a.k.a. Drei-K-Tech) had become the Internet’s largest source of application-layer DDoS attacks. In November 2025, the security firm GreyNoise Intelligence found that Internet addresses on 3XK Tech were responsible for roughly three-quarters of the Internet scanning being done at the time for a newly discovered and critical vulnerability in security products made by Palo Alto Networks.\n\nSource: Cloudflare’s Q2 2025 DDoS threat report.\n\nLinkedIn has a profile for another Plainproxies employee, Julia Levi, who is listed as co-founder of ByteConnect. Ms. Levi did not respond to requests for comment.

Managers attempting to add AI agents to existing human teams may find that bots fail to faithfully follow their instructions, return pointless or obvious results or burn precious time and resources spinning on tasks that older, simpler systems could have accomplished just as well.</p>\n<p>The technical innovators getting the most out of AI are finding that the technology can be remarkably human in its behavior. And the more groups of AI agents are given tasks that require cooperation and collaboration, the more those human-like dynamics emerge.</p>\n<p>Our research suggests that, because of how directly they seem to apply to hybrid teams of human and digital workers, the most effective leaders in the coming years may still be those who excel at understanding the timeworn principles of human management.</p>\n<p>We have spent years studying the risks and opportunities for organizations adopting AI. Our 2025 book, <em>Rewiring Democracy</em>, examines lessons from AI adoption in government institutions and civil society worldwide. In it, we identify where the technology has made the biggest impact and where it fails to make a difference. Today, we see many of the organizations we&#8217;ve studied taking another shot at AI adoption&#8212;this time, with agentic tools. While generative AI generates, <em>agentic AI </em>acts and achieves goals such as automating supply chain processes, making data-driven investment decisions or managing complex project workflows. The cutting edge of AI development research is starting to reveal what works best in this new paradigm.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Agentic AI</h3>\n<p>There are four key areas where AI should reliably boast superhuman performance: in speed, scale, scope and sophistication. Again and again, the most impactful AI applications leverage their capabilities in one or more of these areas. Think of content-moderation AI that can scan thousands of posts in an instant, legislative policy tools that can scale deliberations to millions of constituents, and protein-folding AI that can model molecular interactions with greater sophistication than any biophysicist.</p>\n<p>Equally, AI applications that don&#8217;t leverage these core capabilities typically fail to impress. For example, Google&#8217;s AI Overviews irritate many of its users when the overviews obscure information that could be more efficiently consumed straight from the web results that the AI attempted to synthesize.</p>\n<p>Agentic AI extends these core advantages of AI to new tasks and scenarios. The most familiar AI tools are chatbots, image generators and other models that take a single action: ask one question, get one answer. Agentic systems solve more complex problems by using many such AI models and giving each one the capability to use tools like retrieving information from databases and perform tasks like sending emails or executing financial transactions.</p>\n<p>Because agentic systems are so new and their potential configurations so vast, we are still learning which business processes they will fit well with and which they will not. Gartner has estimated that 40 per cent of agentic AI projects will be cancelled within two years, largely because they are targeted where they can&#8217;t achieve meaningful business impact.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Agentic AI behavior</h3>\n<p>To understand the collective behaviors of agentic AI systems, we need to examine the individual AIs that comprise them. When AIs make mistakes or make things up, they can behave in ways that are truly bizarre. But when they work well, the reasons why are sometimes surprisingly relatable.</p>\n<p>Tools like ChatGPT drew attention by sounding human. Moreover, individual AIs often behave like individual people, responding to incentives and organizing their own work in much the same ways that humans do. Recall the counterintuitive findings of many early users of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) in 2022: They seemed to perform better when offered a cash tip, told the answer was really important or were threatened with hypothetical punishments.</p>\n<p>One of the most effective and enduring techniques discovered in those early days of LLM testing was &#8216;chain-of-thought prompting,&#8217; which instructed AIs to think through and explain each step of their analysis&#8212;much like a teacher forcing a student to show their work. Individual AIs can also react to new information similar to individual people. Researchers have found that LLMs can be effective at simulating the opinions of individual people or demographic groups on diverse topics, including consumer preferences and politics.</p>\n<p>As agentic AI develops, we are finding that groups of AIs also exhibit human-like behaviors collectively. A 2025 paper found that communities of thousands of AI agents set to chat with each other developed familiar human social behaviors like settling into echo chambers. Other researchers have observed the emergence of cooperative and competitive strategies and the development of distinct behavioral roles when setting groups of AIs to play a game together.</p>\n<p>The fact that groups of agentic AIs are working more like human teams doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate that machines have inherently human-like characteristics. It may be more nurture than nature: AIs are being designed with inspiration from humans. The breakthrough triumph of ChatGPT was widely attributed to using human feedback during training. Since then, AI developers have gotten better at aligning AI models to human expectations. It stands to reason, then, that we may find similarities between the management techniques that work for human workers and for agentic AI.</p>\n<h3>Lessons From the Frontier</h3>\n<p>So, how best to manage hybrid teams of humans and agentic AIs? Lessons can be gleaned from leading AI labs. In a recent research report, Anthropic shared the practical roadmap and published lessons learned while building its Claude Research feature, which uses teams of multiple AI agents to accomplish complex reasoning tasks. For example, using agents to search the web for information and calling external tools to access information from sources like emails and documents.</p>\n<p>Advancements in agentic AI enabling new offerings like Claude Research and Amazon Q are causing a stir among AI practitioners because they reveal insights from the frontlines of AI research about how to make agentic AI and the hybrid organizations that leverage it more effective. What is striking about Anthropic&#8217;s report is how transparent it is about all the hard-won lessons learned in developing its offering&#8212;and the fact that many of these lessons sound a lot like what we find in classic management texts:</p>\n<h5>LESSON 1: DELEGATION MATTERS.</h5>\n<p>When Anthropic analyzed what factors lead to excellent performance by Claude Research, it turned out that the best agentic systems weren&#8217;t necessarily built on the best or most expensive AI models. Rather, like a good human manager, they need to excel at breaking down and distributing tasks to their digital workers.</p>\n<p>Unlike human teams, agentic systems can enlist as many AI workers as needed, onboard them instantly and immediately set them to work. Organizations that can exploit this scalability property of AI will gain a key advantage, but the hard part is assigning each of them to contribute meaningful, complementary work to the overall project.</p>\n<p>In classical management, this is called delegation. Any good manager knows that, even if they have the most experience and the strongest skills of anyone on their team, they can&#8217;t do it all alone. Delegation is necessary to harness the collective capacity of their team. It turns out this is crucial to AI, too.</p>\n<p>The authors explain this result in terms of &#8216;parallelization&#8217;: Being able to separate the work into small chunks allows many AI agents to contribute work simultaneously, each focusing on one piece of the problem. The research report attributes 80 per cent of the performance differences between agentic AI systems to the total amount of computing resources they leverage.</p>\n<p>Whether or not each individual agent is the smartest in the digital toolbox, the collective has more capacity for reasoning when there are many AI &#8216;hands&#8217; working together. In addition to the quality of the output, teams working in parallel get work done faster. Anthropic says that reconfiguring its AI agents to work in parallel improved research speed by 90 per cent.</p>\n<p>Anthropic&#8217;s report on how to orchestrate agentic systems effectively reads like a classical delegation training manual: Provide a clear objective, specify the output you expect and provide guidance on what tools to use, and set boundaries. When the objective and output format is not clear, workers may come back with irrelevant or irreconcilable information.</p>\n<h5>LESSON 2: ITERATION MATTERS.</h5>\n<p>Edison famously tested thousands of light bulb designs and filament materials before arriving at a workable solution. Likewise, successful agentic AI systems work far better when they are allowed to learn from their early attempts and then try again. Claude Research spawns a multitude of AI agents, each doubling and tripling back on their own work as they go through a trial-and-error process to land on the right results.</p>\n<p>This is exactly how management researchers have recommended organizations staff novel projects where large teams are tasked with exploring unfamiliar terrain: Teams should split up and conduct trial-and-error learning, in parallel, like a pharmaceutical company progressing multiple molecules towards a potential clinical trial. Even when one candidate seems to have the strongest chances at the outset, there is no telling in advance which one will improve the most as it is iterated upon.</p>\n<p>The advantage of using AI for this iterative process is speed: AI agents can complete and retry their tasks in milliseconds. A recent report from Microsoft Research illustrates this. Its agentic AI system launched up to five AI worker teams in a race to finish a task first, each plotting and pursuing its own iterative path to the destination. They found that a five-team system typically returned results about twice as fast as a single AI worker team with no loss in effectiveness, although at the cost of about twice as much total computing spend.</p>\n<p>Going further, Claude Research&#8217;s system design endowed its top-level AI agent&#8212;the &#8216;Lead Researcher&#8217;&#8212;with the decision authority to delegate more research iterations if it was not satisfied with the results returned by its sub-agents. They managed the choice of whether or not they should continue their iterative search loop, to a limit. To the extent that agentic AI mirrors the world of human management, this might be one of the most important topics to watch going forward. Deciding when to stop and what is &#8216;good enough&#8217; has always been one of the hardest problems organizations face.</p>\n<h5>LESSON 3: EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SHARING MATTERS.</h5>\n<p>If you work in a manufacturing department, you wouldn&#8217;t rely on your division chief to explain the specs you need to meet for a new product. You would go straight to the source: the domain experts in R&amp;D. Successful organizations need to be able to share complex information efficiently both vertically and horizontally.</p>\n<p>To solve the horizontal sharing problem for Claude Research, Anthropic innovated a novel mechanism for AI agents to share their outputs directly with each other by writing directly to a common file system, like a corporate intranet. In addition to saving on the cost of the central coordinator having to consume every sub-agent&#8217;s output, this approach helps resolve the information bottleneck. It enables AI agents that have become specialized in their tasks to own how their content is presented to the larger digital team. This is a smart way to leverage the superhuman scope of AI workers, enabling each of many AI agents to act as distinct subject matter experts.</p>\n<p>In effect, Anthropic&#8217;s AI Lead Researchers must be generalist managers. Their job is to see the big picture and translate that into the guidance that sub-agents need to do their work. They don&#8217;t need to be experts on every task the sub-agents are performing. The parallel goes further: AIs working together also need to know the limits of information sharing, like what kinds of tasks don&#8217;t make sense to distribute horizontally.</p>\n<p>Management scholars suggest that human organizations focus on automating the smallest tasks; the ones that are most repeatable and that can be executed the most independently. Tasks that require more interaction between people tend to go slower, since the communication not only adds overhead, but is something that many struggle to do effectively.</p>\n<p>Anthropic found much the same was true of its AI agents: &#8220;Domains that require all agents to share the same context or involve many dependencies between agents are not a good fit for multi-agent systems today.&#8221; This is why the company focused its premier agentic AI feature on research, a process that can leverage a large number of sub-agents each performing repetitive, isolated searches before compiling and synthesizing the results.</p>\n<p>All of these lessons lead to the conclusion that knowing your team and paying keen attention to how to get the best out of them will continue to be the most important skill of successful managers of both humans and AIs. With humans, we call this leadership skill <em>empathy</em>. That concept doesn&#8217;t apply to AIs, but the techniques of empathic managers do.</p>\n<p>Anthropic got the most out of its AI agents by performing a thoughtful, systematic analysis of their performance and what supports they benefited from, and then used that insight to optimize how they execute as a team. Claude Research is designed to put different AI models in the positions where they are most likely to succeed. Anthropic&#8217;s most intelligent Opus model takes the Lead Researcher role, while their cheaper and faster Sonnet model fulfills the more numerous sub-agent roles. Anthropic has analyzed how to distribute responsibility and share information across its digital worker network. And it knows that the next generation of AI models might work in importantly different ways, so it has built performance measurement and management systems that help it tune its organizational architecture to adapt to the characteristics of its AI &#8216;workers.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>Managers of hybrid teams can apply these ideas to design their own complex systems of human and digital workers:</p>\n<h5>DELEGATE.</h5>\n<p>Analyze the tasks in your workflows so that you can design a division of labour that plays to the strength of each of your resources. Entrust your most experienced humans with the roles that require context and judgment and entrust AI models with the tasks that need to be done quickly or benefit from extreme parallelization.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re building a hybrid customer service organization, let AIs handle tasks like eliciting pertinent information from customers and suggesting common solutions. But always escalate to human representatives to resolve unique situations and offer accommodations, especially when doing so can carry legal obligations and financial ramifications. To help them work together well, task the AI agents with preparing concise briefs compiling the case history and potential resolutions to help humans jump into the conversation.</p>\n<h5>ITERATE.</h5>\n<p>AIs will likely underperform your top human team members when it comes to solving novel problems in the fields in which they are expert. But AI agents&#8217; speed and parallelization still make them valuable partners. Look for ways to augment human-led explorations of new territory with agentic AI scouting teams that can explore many paths for them in advance.</p>\n<p>Hybrid software development teams will especially benefit from this strategy. Agentic coding AI systems are capable of building apps, autonomously making improvements to and bug-fixing their code to meet a spec. But without humans in the loop, they can fall into rabbit holes. Examples abound of AI-generated code that might appear to satisfy specified requirements, but diverges from products that meet organizational requirements for security, integration or user experiences that humans would truly desire. Take advantage of the fast iteration of AI programmers to test different solutions, but make sure your human team is checking its work and redirecting the AI when needed.</p>\n<h5>SHARE.</h5>\n<p>Make sure each of your hybrid team&#8217;s outputs are accessible to each other so that they can benefit from each others&#8217; work products. Make sure workers doing hand-offs write down clear instructions with enough context that either a human colleague or AI model could follow. Anthropic found that AI teams benefited from clearly communicating their work to each other, and the same will be true of communication between humans and AI in hybrid teams.</p>\n<h5>MEASURE AND IMPROVE.</h5>\n<p>Organizations should always strive to grow the capabilities of their human team members over time. Assume that the capabilities and behaviors of your AI team members will change over time, too, but at a much faster rate. So will the ways the humans and AIs interact together. Make sure to understand how they are performing individually and together at the task level, and plan to experiment with the roles you ask AI workers to take on as the technology evolves.</p>\n<p>An important example of this comes from medical imaging. Harvard Medical School researchers have found that hybrid AI-physician teams have wildly varying performance as diagnosticians. The problem wasn&#8217;t necessarily that the AI has poor or inconsistent performance; what mattered was the interaction between person and machine. Different doctors&#8217; diagnostic performance benefited&#8212;or suffered&#8212;at different levels when they used AI tools. Being able to measure and optimize those interactions, perhaps at the individual level, will be critical to hybrid organizations.</p>\n<h3>In Closing</h3>\n<p>We are in a phase of AI technology where the best performance is going to come from mixed teams of humans and AIs working together. Managing those teams is not going to be the same as we&#8217;ve grown used to, but the hard-won lessons of decades past still have a lot to offer.</p>\n<p><em>This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in Rotman Management Magazine.</em></p>\n",

Claude Research is designed to put different AI models in the positions where they are most likely to succeed. Anthropic’s most intelligent Opus model takes the Lead Researcher role, while their cheaper and faster Sonnet model fulfills the more numerous sub-agent roles. Anthropic has analyzed how to distribute responsibility and share information across its digital worker network. And it knows that the next generation of AI models might work in importantly different ways, so it has built performance measurement and management systems that help it tune its organizational architecture to adapt to the characteristics of its AI ‘workers.’\nKey Takeaways\nManagers of hybrid teams can apply these ideas to design their own complex systems of human and digital workers:\nDELEGATE.\nAnalyze the tasks in your workflows so that you can design a division of labour that plays to the strength of each of your resources. Entrust your most experienced humans with the roles that require context and judgment and entrust AI models with the tasks that need to be done quickly or benefit from extreme parallelization.\nIf you’re building a hybrid customer service organization, let AIs handle tasks like eliciting pertinent information from customers and suggesting common solutions. But always escalate to human representatives to resolve unique situations and offer accommodations, especially when doing so can carry legal obligations and financial ramifications. To help them work together well, task the AI agents with preparing concise briefs compiling the case history and potential resolutions to help humans jump into the conversation.\nITERATE.\nAIs will likely underperform your top human team members when it comes to solving novel problems in the fields in which they are expert. But AI agents’ speed and parallelization still make them valuable partners. Look for ways to augment human-led explorations of new territory with agentic AI scouting teams that can explore many paths for them in advance.\nHybrid software development teams will especially benefit from this strategy. Agentic coding AI systems are capable of building apps, autonomously making improvements to and bug-fixing their code to meet a spec. But without humans in the loop, they can fall into rabbit holes. Examples abound of AI-generated code that might appear to satisfy specified requirements, but diverges from products that meet organizational requirements for security, integration or user experiences that humans would truly desire. Take advantage of the fast iteration of AI programmers to test different solutions, but make sure your human team is checking its work and redirecting the AI when needed.\nSHARE.\nMake sure each of your hybrid team’s outputs are accessible to each other so that they can benefit from each others’ work products. Make sure workers doing hand-offs write down clear instructions with enough context that either a human colleague or AI model could follow. Anthropic found that AI teams benefited from clearly communicating their work to each other, and the same will be true of communication between humans and AI in hybrid teams.\nMEASURE AND IMPROVE.\nOrganizations should always strive to grow the capabilities of their human team members over time. Assume that the capabilities and behaviors of your AI team members will change over time, too, but at a much faster rate. So will the ways the humans and AIs interact together. Make sure to understand how they are performing individually and together at the task level, and plan to experiment with the roles you ask AI workers to take on as the technology evolves.\nAn important example of this comes from medical imaging. Harvard Medical School researchers have found that hybrid AI-physician teams have wildly varying performance as diagnosticians. The problem wasn’t necessarily that the AI has poor or inconsistent performance; what mattered was the interaction between person and machine. Different doctors’ diagnostic performance benefited—or suffered—at different levels when they used AI tools. Being able to measure and optimize those interactions, perhaps at the individual level, will be critical to hybrid organizations.\nIn Closing\nWe are in a phase of AI technology where the best performance is going to come from mixed teams of humans and AIs working together. Managing those teams is not going to be the same as we’ve grown used to, but the hard-won lessons of decades past still have a lot to offer.\nThis essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in Rotman Management Magazine.",
