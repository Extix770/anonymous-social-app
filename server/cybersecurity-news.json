But the tables seem to have turned somewhat for &#8220;Rey,&#8221; the moniker chosen by the technical operator and public face of the hacker group: Earlier this week, Rey confirmed his real life identity and agreed to an interview after KrebsOnSecurity tracked him down and contacted his father.</p>\n<p>Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (SLSH) is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups — <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=scattered+spider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Scattered Spider</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=lapsus%24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>LAPSUS$</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=shiny+hunters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ShinyHunters</strong></a>. Members of these gangs hail from many of the same chat channels on the <strong>Com</strong>, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.</p>\n<p>In May 2025, SLSH members launched <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/shinyhunters-wage-broad-corporate-extortion-spree/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a social engineering campaign</a> that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization’s Salesforce portal.

Read on to learn how it all unraveled for Rey.<span id=\"more-72704\"></span></p>\n<h2>WHO IS REY?</h2>\n<p>According to the cyber intelligence firm <strong>Intel 471</strong>, Rey was an active user on various <strong>BreachForums</strong> reincarnations over the past two years, authoring more than 200 posts between February 2024 and July 2025. Intel 471 says Rey previously used the handle &#8220;<strong>Hikki-Chan</strong>&#8221; on BreachForums, where their first post shared data allegedly stolen from the <strong>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</strong> (CDC).</p>\n<p>In that February 2024 post about the CDC, Hikki-Chan says they could be reached at the Telegram username <strong>@wristmug</strong>. In May 2024, @wristmug posted in a Telegram group chat called &#8220;Pantifan&#8221; a copy of an extortion email they said they received that included their email address and password.</p>\n<p>The message that @wristmug cut and pasted appears to have been part of an <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">automated email scam</a> that claims it was sent by a hacker who has compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. These missives threaten to release the video to all your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom, and they typically reference a real password the recipient has used previously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Noooooo,&#8221; the @wristmug account wrote in mock horror after posting a screenshot of the scam message. &#8220;I must be done guys.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72731\" style=\"width: 533px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72731\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72731\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mustbedone.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"523\" height=\"800\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A message posted to Telegram by Rey/@wristmug.</p></div>\n<p>In posting their screenshot, @wristmug redacted the username portion of the email address referenced in the body of the scam message. However, they did not redact their previously-used password, and they left the domain portion of their email address (@proton.me) visible in the screenshot.</p>\n<h2>O5TDEV</h2>\n<p>Searching on @wristmug&#8217;s rather unique 15-character password in the breach tracking service <strong>Spycloud</strong> finds it is known to have been used by just one email address: <strong>cybero5tdev@proton.me</strong>. According to Spycloud, those credentials were exposed at least twice in early 2024 when this user&#8217;s device was infected with an infostealer trojan that siphoned all of its stored usernames, passwords and authentication cookies (a finding that was <a href=\"https://www.kelacyber.com/blog/hellcat-hacking-group-unmasked-rey-and-pryx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">initially revealed</a> in March 2025 by the cyber intelligence firm <strong>KELA</strong>).</p>\n<p>Intel 471 shows the email address cybero5tdev@proton.me belonged to a BreachForums member who went by the username <strong>o5tdev</strong>.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "A prolific cybercriminal group that calls itself “Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters” has dominated headlines this year by regularly stealing data from and publicly mass extorting dozens of major corporations. But the tables seem to have turned somewhat for “Rey,” the moniker chosen by the technical operator and public face of the hacker group: Earlier this week, Rey confirmed his real life identity and agreed to an interview after KrebsOnSecurity tracked him down and contacted his father.\nScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (SLSH) is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups — Scattered Spider, LAPSUS$ and ShinyHunters. Members of these gangs hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\nIn May 2025, SLSH members launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization’s Salesforce portal. The group later launched a data leak portal that threatened to publish the internal data of three dozen companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS.\n\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters, which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\n\nLast week, the SLSH Telegram channel featured an offer to recruit and reward “insiders,” employees at large companies who agree to share internal access to their employer’s network for a share of whatever ransom payment is ultimately paid by the victim company.\nSLSH has solicited insider access previously, but their latest call for disgruntled employees started making the rounds on social media at the same time news broke that the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike had fired an employee for allegedly sharing screenshots of internal systems with the hacker group (Crowdstrike said their systems were never compromised and that it has turned the matter over to law enforcement agencies).\n\nThe Telegram server for the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters has been attempting to recruit insiders at large companies.\n\nMembers of SLSH have traditionally used other ransomware gangs’ encryptors in attacks, including malware from ransomware affiliate programs like ALPHV/BlackCat, Qilin, RansomHub, and DragonForce. But last week, SLSH announced on its Telegram channel the release of their own ransomware-as-a-service operation called ShinySp1d3r.\nThe individual responsible for releasing the ShinySp1d3r ransomware offering is a core SLSH member who goes by the handle “Rey” and who is currently one of just three administrators of the SLSH Telegram channel. Previously, Rey was an administrator of the data leak website for Hellcat, a ransomware group that surfaced in late 2024 and was involved in attacks on companies including Schneider Electric, Telefonica, and Orange Romania.\n\nA recent, slightly redacted screenshot of the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters Telegram channel description, showing Rey as one of three administrators.\n\nAlso in 2024, Rey would take over as administrator of the most recent incarnation of BreachForums, an English-language cybercrime forum whose domain names have been seized on multiple occasions by the FBI and/or by international authorities. In April 2025, Rey posted on Twitter/X about another FBI seizure of BreachForums.\nOn October 5, 2025, the FBI announced it had once again seized the domains associated with BreachForums, which it described as a major criminal marketplace used by ShinyHunters and others to traffic in stolen data and facilitate extortion.\n“This takedown removes access to a key hub used by these actors to monetize intrusions, recruit collaborators, and target victims across multiple sectors,” the FBI said.\nIncredibly, Rey would make a series of critical operational security mistakes last year that provided multiple avenues to ascertain and confirm his real-life identity and location. Read on to learn how it all unraveled for Rey.\nWHO IS REY?\nAccording to the cyber intelligence firm Intel 471, Rey was an active user on various BreachForums reincarnations over the past two years, authoring more than 200 posts between February 2024 and July 2025. Intel 471 says Rey previously used the handle “Hikki-Chan” on BreachForums, where their first post shared data allegedly stolen from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nIn that February 2024 post about the CDC, Hikki-Chan says they could be reached at the Telegram username @wristmug. In May 2024, @wristmug posted in a Telegram group chat called “Pantifan” a copy of an extortion email they said they received that included their email address and password.\nThe message that @wristmug cut and pasted appears to have been part of an automated email scam that claims it was sent by a hacker who has compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. These missives threaten to release the video to all your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom, and they typically reference a real password the recipient has used previously.\n“Noooooo,” the @wristmug account wrote in mock horror after posting a screenshot of the scam message. “I must be done guys.”\n\nA message posted to Telegram by Rey/@wristmug.\n\nIn posting their screenshot, @wristmug redacted the username portion of the email address referenced in the body of the scam message. However, they did not redact their previously-used password, and they left the domain portion of their email address (@proton.me) visible in the screenshot.\nO5TDEV\nSearching on @wristmug’s rather unique 15-character password in the breach tracking service Spycloud finds it is known to have been used by just one email address: cybero5tdev@proton.me. According to Spycloud, those credentials were exposed at least twice in early 2024 when this user’s device was infected with an infostealer trojan that siphoned all of its stored usernames, passwords and authentication cookies (a finding that was initially revealed in March 2025 by the cyber intelligence firm KELA).\nIntel 471 shows the email address cybero5tdev@proton.me belonged to a BreachForums member who went by the username o5tdev. Searching on this nickname in Google brings up at least two website defacement archives showing that a user named o5tdev was previously involved in defacing sites with pro-Palestinian messages. The screenshot below, for example, shows that 05tdev was part of a group called Cyb3r Drag0nz Team.\n\nRey/o5tdev’s defacement pages. Image: archive.org.\n\nA 2023 report from SentinelOne described Cyb3r Drag0nz Team as a hacktivist group with a history of launching DDoS attacks and cyber defacements as well as engaging in data leak activity.\n“Cyb3r Drag0nz Team claims to have leaked data on over a million of Israeli citizens spread across multiple leaks,” SentinelOne reported. “To date, the group has released multiple .RAR archives of purported personal information on citizens across Israel.”\nThe cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint finds the Telegram user @05tdev was active in 2023 and early 2024, posting in Arabic on anti-Israel channels like “Ghost of Palestine” [full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this blog].\n‘I’M A GINTY’\nFlashpoint shows that Rey’s Telegram account (ID7047194296) was particularly active in a cybercrime-focused channel called Jacuzzi, where this user shared several personal details, including that their father was an airline pilot. Rey claimed in 2024 to be 15 years old, and to have family connections to Ireland.\nSpecifically, Rey mentioned in several Telegram chats that he had Irish heritage, even posting a graphic that shows the prevalence of the surname “Ginty.”\n\nRey, on Telegram claiming to have association to the surname “Ginty.” Image: Flashpoint.\n\nSpycloud indexed hundreds of credentials stolen from cybero5dev@proton.me, and those details indicate that Rey’s computer is a shared Microsoft Windows device located in Amman, Jordan. The credential data stolen from Rey in early 2024 show there are multiple users of the infected PC, but that all shared the same last name of Khader and an address in Amman, Jordan.\nThe “autofill” data lifted from Rey’s family PC contains an entry for a 46-year-old Zaid Khader that says his mother’s maiden name was Ginty. The infostealer data also shows Zaid Khader frequently accessed internal websites for employees of Royal Jordanian Airlines.\nMEET SAIF\nThe infostealer data makes clear that Rey’s full name is Saif Al-Din Khader.

When Edward Snowden had exposed the NSA’s operations abroad, he’d ended up in exile in Russia. Wan, too, might have risked arrest had he still been living in China.\n\nHere are two book reviews.",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Democracy is colliding with the technologies of artificial intelligence. Judging from the audience reaction at the recent <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/world-forum-democracy\">World Forum on Democracy</a> in Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities.</p>\n<p>We have just published the book <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/\">Rewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship</a><em>.</em> In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better.</p>\n<p>Here are four such stories unfolding right now around the world, showing how AI is being used by some to make democracy better, stronger, and more responsive to people.</p>\n<h3>Japan</h3>\n<p>Last year, then 33-year-old engineer Takahiro Anno was a fringe candidate for governor of Tokyo. Running as an independent candidate, he ended up coming in fifth in a crowded <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/world/asia/tokyo-governors-election.html\">field of 56</a>, largely thanks to the unprecedented use of an authorized AI avatar. That avatar answered <a href=\"https://futurepolis.substack.com/p/meet-your-ai-politician-of-the-future\">8,600 questions from voters</a> on a 17-day continuous YouTube livestream and garnered the attention of campaign innovators worldwide.</p>\n<p>Two months ago, Anno-san was <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20250722/p2a/00m/0na/016000c\">elected</a> to Japan&#8217;s upper legislative chamber, again leveraging the power of AI to engage constituents&#8212;this time answering <a href=\"https://note-com.translate.goog/annotakahiro24/n/n4ec669d391dd?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc&amp;_x_tr_hist=true\">more than 20,000 questions</a>. His new party, Team Mirai, is also an AI-enabled civic technology shop, producing software aimed at making governance better and more participatory. The party is leveraging its share of Japan&#8217;s public funding for political parties to build the <a href=\"https://note.com/team_mirai_jp/n/nd1656aa5f86d\">Mirai Assembly</a> app, enabling constituents to express opinions on and ask questions about bills in the legislature, and to organize those expressions using AI. The party promises that its members will <a href=\"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/291183/team-mirai-in-spotlight-with-aim-to-update-democracy-with-tech\">direct their questioning</a> in committee hearings based on public input.</p>\n<h3>Brazil</h3>\n<p>Brazil is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/11/05/359830235/brazil-the-land-of-many-lawyers-and-very-slow-justice\">notoriously litigious</a>, with even more lawyers per capita than the US. The courts are chronically overwhelmed with cases and the resultant backlog costs the government billions to process. Estimates are that the Brazilian federal government spends about 1.6% of GDP per year <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/business/2024/01/brazil-leads-spending-on-courts-among-53-countries.shtml\">operating the courts</a> and another 2.5% to 3% of GDP issuing <a href=\"https://valorinternational.globo.com/economy/news/2025/04/11/federal-court-losses-already-consume-25percent-of-gdp-annually.ghtml\">court-ordered payments</a> from lawsuits the government has lost.</p>\n<p>Since at least 2019, the Brazilian government has <a href=\"https://www.techandjustice.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/brazil\">aggressively adopted</a> AI to automate procedures throughout its judiciary. AI is not making judicial decisions, but aiding in distributing caseloads, performing legal research, transcribing hearings, identifying duplicative filings, preparing initial orders for signature and clustering similar cases for joint consideration: all things to make the judiciary system work more efficiently. And the results are significant; Brazil&#8217;s federal supreme court backlog, for example, dropped in 2025 to its <a href=\"https://noticias-stf-wp-prd.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/wpallimport/uploads/2025/07/01191513/PRESTACAO-JURISDICIONAL-2025-4.pdf\">lowest levels in 33 years</a>.</p>\n<p>While it seems clear that the courts are realizing efficiency benefits from leveraging AI, there is a postscript to the courts&#8217; AI implementation project over the past five-plus years: the litigators are using these tools, too. Lawyers are using AI assistance to file cases in Brazilian courts at an <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2025/latin-america-judges-ai-crimes/\">unprecedented rate</a>, with new cases growing by nearly 40% in volume over the past five years.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing for Brazilian litigators to regain the upper hand in this arms race. It has been argued that litigation, particularly against the government, is a vital form of <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/30245797\">civic participation</a>, essential to the <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1147&amp;context=elj\">self-governance function</a> of democracy. Other democracies&#8217; court systems should study and learn from Brazil&#8217;s experience and seek to use technology to maximize the bandwidth and liquidity of the courts to process litigation.</p>\n<h3>Germany</h3>\n<p>Now, we move to Europe and innovations in informing voters. Since 2002, the German Federal Agency for Civic Education has operated a non-partisan voting guide called <a href=\"https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/bundestagswahl2025/app/main_app.html\">Wahl-o-Mat</a>. Officials convene an editorial team of 24 young voters (under 26 and selected for diversity) with experts from science and education to develop a slate of 80 questions. The questions are put to all registered German political parties. The responses are narrowed down to 38 key topics and then published online in a quiz format that voters can use to identify the party whose platform they most identify with.</p>\n<p>In the past two years, outside groups have been innovating alternatives to the official Wahl-o-Mat guide that leverage AI. First came <a href=\"https://www.heise.de/en/news/Electorally-How-artificial-intelligence-should-help-with-voting-decisions-9824511.html\">Wahlweise</a>, a product of the German AI company AIUI. Second, students at the Technical University of Munich deployed an interactive AI system called <a href=\"https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/news/article/wahlchat/\">Wahl.chat</a>. This tool was used by more than <a href=\"https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/technology-for-democracy\">150,000 people</a> within the first four months. In both cases, instead of having to read static webpages about the positions of various political parties, citizens can engage in an interactive conversation with an AI system to more easily get the same information contextualized to their individual interests and questions.</p>\n<p>However, German researchers studying the reliability of such AI tools ahead of the 2025 German federal election raised significant <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15568\">concerns</a> about bias and &#8220;hallucinations&#8221;&#8212;AI tools making up false information. Acknowledging the potential of the technology to increase voter informedness and party transparency, the researchers recommended adopting scientific evaluations comparable to those used in the Agency for Civic Education&#8217;s official tool to improve and institutionalize the technology.</p>\n<h3>United States</h3>\n<p>Finally, the US&#8212;in particular, California, home to <a href=\"https://calmatters.org\">CalMatters</a>, a non-profit, nonpartisan news organization. Since 2023, its <a href=\"https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org\">Digital Democracy</a> project has been collecting every public utterance of California elected officials&#8212;every floor speech, comment made in committee and social media post, along with their voting records, legislation, and campaign contributions&#8212;and making all that information available in a free online platform.</p>\n<p>CalMatters this year launched a new feature that takes this kind of civic watchdog function a big step further. Its <a href=\"https://dicktofel.substack.com/p/bringing-digital-democracy-to-california\">AI Tip Sheets</a> feature uses AI to search through all of this data, looking for anomalies, such as a change in voting position tied to a large campaign contribution. These anomalies appear on a webpage that journalists can access to give them story ideas and a source of data and analysis to drive further reporting.</p>\n<p>This is not AI replacing human journalists; it is a civic watchdog organization using technology to feed evidence-based insights to human reporters. And it&#8217;s no coincidence that this innovation arose from a new kind of media institution&#8212;a non-profit news agency. As the watchdog function of the fourth estate continues to be degraded by the decline of newspapers&#8217; business models, this kind of technological support is a valuable contribution to help a reduced number of human journalists retain something of the scope of action and impact our democracy relies on them for.</p>\n<p>These are just four of many stories from around the globe of AI helping to make democracy stronger. The common thread is that the technology is distributing rather than concentrating power. In all four cases, it is being used to assist people performing their democratic tasks&#8212;politics in Japan, litigation in Brazil, voting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> and watchdog journalism in California&#8212;rather than replacing them.</p>\n<p>In none of these cases is the AI doing something that humans can&#8217;t perfectly competently do. But in all of these cases, we don&#8217;t have enough available humans to do the jobs on their own. A sufficiently trustworthy AI can fill in gaps: amplify the power of civil servants and citizens, improve efficiency, and facilitate engagement between government and the public.</p>\n<p>One of the barriers towards realizing this vision more broadly is the AI market itself. The core technologies are largely being created and marketed by US tech giants. We don&#8217;t know the details of their development: on what material they were trained, what guardrails are designed to shape their behavior, what biases and values are encoded into their systems.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Democracy is colliding with the technologies of artificial intelligence. Judging from the audience reaction at the recent World Forum on Democracy in Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities.\nWe have just published the book Rewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship. In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better.\nHere are four such stories unfolding right now around the world, showing how AI is being used by some to make democracy better, stronger, and more responsive to people.\nJapan\nLast year, then 33-year-old engineer Takahiro Anno was a fringe candidate for governor of Tokyo. Running as an independent candidate, he ended up coming in fifth in a crowded field of 56, largely thanks to the unprecedented use of an authorized AI avatar. That avatar answered 8,600 questions from voters on a 17-day continuous YouTube livestream and garnered the attention of campaign innovators worldwide.\nTwo months ago, Anno-san was elected to Japan’s upper legislative chamber, again leveraging the power of AI to engage constituents—this time answering more than 20,000 questions. His new party, Team Mirai, is also an AI-enabled civic technology shop, producing software aimed at making governance better and more participatory. The party is leveraging its share of Japan’s public funding for political parties to build the Mirai Assembly app, enabling constituents to express opinions on and ask questions about bills in the legislature, and to organize those expressions using AI. The party promises that its members will direct their questioning in committee hearings based on public input.\nBrazil\nBrazil is notoriously litigious, with even more lawyers per capita than the US. The courts are chronically overwhelmed with cases and the resultant backlog costs the government billions to process. Estimates are that the Brazilian federal government spends about 1.6% of GDP per year operating the courts and another 2.5% to 3% of GDP issuing court-ordered payments from lawsuits the government has lost.\nSince at least 2019, the Brazilian government has aggressively adopted AI to automate procedures throughout its judiciary. AI is not making judicial decisions, but aiding in distributing caseloads, performing legal research, transcribing hearings, identifying duplicative filings, preparing initial orders for signature and clustering similar cases for joint consideration: all things to make the judiciary system work more efficiently. And the results are significant; Brazil’s federal supreme court backlog, for example, dropped in 2025 to its lowest levels in 33 years.\nWhile it seems clear that the courts are realizing efficiency benefits from leveraging AI, there is a postscript to the courts’ AI implementation project over the past five-plus years: the litigators are using these tools, too. Lawyers are using AI assistance to file cases in Brazilian courts at an unprecedented rate, with new cases growing by nearly 40% in volume over the past five years.\nIt’s not necessarily a bad thing for Brazilian litigators to regain the upper hand in this arms race. It has been argued that litigation, particularly against the government, is a vital form of civic participation, essential to the self-governance function of democracy. Other democracies’ court systems should study and learn from Brazil’s experience and seek to use technology to maximize the bandwidth and liquidity of the courts to process litigation.\nGermany\nNow, we move to Europe and innovations in informing voters. Since 2002, the German Federal Agency for Civic Education has operated a non-partisan voting guide called Wahl-o-Mat. Officials convene an editorial team of 24 young voters (under 26 and selected for diversity) with experts from science and education to develop a slate of 80 questions. The questions are put to all registered German political parties. The responses are narrowed down to 38 key topics and then published online in a quiz format that voters can use to identify the party whose platform they most identify with.\nIn the past two years, outside groups have been innovating alternatives to the official Wahl-o-Mat guide that leverage AI. First came Wahlweise, a product of the German AI company AIUI. Second, students at the Technical University of Munich deployed an interactive AI system called Wahl.chat. This tool was used by more than 150,000 people within the first four months. In both cases, instead of having to read static webpages about the positions of various political parties, citizens can engage in an interactive conversation with an AI system to more easily get the same information contextualized to their individual interests and questions.\nHowever, German researchers studying the reliability of such AI tools ahead of the 2025 German federal election raised significant concerns about bias and “hallucinations”—AI tools making up false information. Acknowledging the potential of the technology to increase voter informedness and party transparency, the researchers recommended adopting scientific evaluations comparable to those used in the Agency for Civic Education’s official tool to improve and institutionalize the technology.\nUnited States\nFinally, the US—in particular, California, home to CalMatters, a non-profit, nonpartisan news organization. Since 2023, its Digital Democracy project has been collecting every public utterance of California elected officials—every floor speech, comment made in committee and social media post, along with their voting records, legislation, and campaign contributions—and making all that information available in a free online platform.\nCalMatters this year launched a new feature that takes this kind of civic watchdog function a big step further. Its AI Tip Sheets feature uses AI to search through all of this data, looking for anomalies, such as a change in voting position tied to a large campaign contribution. These anomalies appear on a webpage that journalists can access to give them story ideas and a source of data and analysis to drive further reporting.\nThis is not AI replacing human journalists; it is a civic watchdog organization using technology to feed evidence-based insights to human reporters. And it’s no coincidence that this innovation arose from a new kind of media institution—a non-profit news agency. As the watchdog function of the fourth estate continues to be degraded by the decline of newspapers’ business models, this kind of technological support is a valuable contribution to help a reduced number of human journalists retain something of the scope of action and impact our democracy relies on them for.\nThese are just four of many stories from around the globe of AI helping to make democracy stronger. The common thread is that the technology is distributing rather than concentrating power. In all four cases, it is being used to assist people performing their democratic tasks—politics in Japan, litigation in Brazil, voting in Germany and watchdog journalism in California—rather than replacing them.\nIn none of these cases is the AI doing something that humans can’t perfectly competently do. But in all of these cases, we don’t have enough available humans to do the jobs on their own. A sufficiently trustworthy AI can fill in gaps: amplify the power of civil servants and citizens, improve efficiency, and facilitate engagement between government and the public.\nOne of the barriers towards realizing this vision more broadly is the AI market itself. The core technologies are largely being created and marketed by US tech giants. We don’t know the details of their development: on what material they were trained, what guardrails are designed to shape their behavior, what biases and values are encoded into their systems. And, even worse, we don’t get a say in the choices associated with those details or how they should change over time. In many cases, it’s an unacceptable risk to use these for-profit, proprietary AI systems in democratic contexts.\nTo address that, we have long advocated for the development of “public AI”: models and AI systems that are developed under democratic control and deployed for public benefit, not sold by corporations to benefit their shareholders. The movement for this is growing worldwide.\nSwitzerland has recently released the world’s most powerful and fully realized public AI model. It’s called Apertus, and it was developed jointly by the Swiss government and the university ETH Zurich. The government has made it entirely open source—open data, open code, open weights—and free for anyone to use. No illegally acquired copyrighted works were used in its training. It doesn’t exploit poorly paid human laborers from the global south. Its performance is about where the large corporate giants were a year ago, which is more than good enough for many applications. And it demonstrates that it’s not necessary to spend trillions of dollars creating these models. Apertus takes a huge step forward to realizing the vision of an alternative to big tech—controlled corporate AI.\nAI technology is not without its costs and risks, and we are not here to minimize them. But the technology has significant benefits as well.\nAI is inherently power-enhancing, and it can magnify what the humans behind it want to do. It can enhance authoritarianism as easily as it can enhance democracy. It’s up to us to steer the technology in that better direction. If more citizen watchdogs and litigators use AI to amplify their power to oversee government and hold it accountable, if more political parties and election administrators use it to engage meaningfully with and inform voters and if more governments provide democratic alternatives to big tech’s AI offerings, society will be better off.\nThis essay was written with Nathan E.
