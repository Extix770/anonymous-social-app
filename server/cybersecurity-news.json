As the AI tool is connected to various services, an attacker leveraging the CometJacking method could exfiltrate available data.\nIn their tests, the connected services and accessible data include Google Calendar invites and Gmail messages and the malicious prompt included instructions to encode the sensitive data in base64 and then exfiltrate them to an external endpoint.\nAccording to the researchers, Comet followed the instructions and delivered the information to an external system controlled by the attacker, evading Perplexity’s checks.\n\nI wrote previously:\nPrompt injection isn’t just a minor security problem we need to deal with. It’s a fundamental property of current LLM technology. The systems have no ability to separate trusted commands from untrusted data, and there are an infinite number of prompt injection attacks with no way to block them as a class. We need some new fundamental science of LLMs before we can solve this.",
