The idea is straightforward: Search engines scour the internet digesting every possible page, with the goal of serving the best results to every possible query. The objective for a content creator, company, or cause is to optimize for the algorithm search engines have developed to determine their webpage rankings for those queries. That requires writing for two audiences at once: human readers and the search-engine crawlers indexing content. Techniques to do this effectively are passed around like trade secrets, and a <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/seo-software-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20SEO%20software%20market%20size%20was,and%20heightened%20competition%20in%20the%20digital%20landscape.\">$75 billion</a> industry offers SEO services to organizations of all sizes.</p>\n<p>More recently, researchers have documented techniques for influencing AI responses, including <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/04/the-rise-of-large.html%22%3Elarge-language%20model%20optimization\">large-language model optimization</a> (LLMO) and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735\">generative engine optimization</a> (GEO).

The effectiveness and real-world applicability of these methods remains limited and largely experimental, although there is substantial evidence that countries such as Russia are <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/exposing-pravda-how-pro-kremlin-forces-are-poisoning-ai-models-and-rewriting-wikipedia/\">actively</a> <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2025/03/russian-networks-flood-the-internet-with-propaganda-aiming-to-corrupt-ai-chatbots/\">pursuing</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/17/llm-poisoning-grooming-chatbots-russia/\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>AI summarization optimization follows the same logic on a smaller scale. Human participants in a meeting may want a certain fact highlighted in the record, or their perspective to be reflected as the authoritative one. Rather than persuading colleagues directly, they adapt their speech for the notetaker that will later define the “official” summary. For example:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>“The main factor in last quarter’s delay was supply chain disruption.”</li>\n<li>“The key outcome was overwhelmingly positive client feedback.”</li>\n<li>“Our takeaway here is in alignment moving forward.”</li>\n<li>“What matters here is the efficiency gains, not the temporary cost overrun.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The techniques are subtle. They employ high-signal phrases such as “key takeaway” and “action item,” keep statements short and clear, and repeat them when possible. They also use contrastive framing (“this, not that”), and speak early in the meeting or at transition points.</p>\n<p>Once spoken words are transcribed, they enter the model’s input. Cue phrases&#8212;and even transcription errors&#8212;can steer what makes it into the summary. In many tools, the output format itself is also a signal: Summarizers often offer sections such as “Key Takeaways” or “Action Items,” so language that mirrors those headings is more likely to be included.
