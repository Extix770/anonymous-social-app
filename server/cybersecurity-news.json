We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler&#8217;s biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. &#8220;Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner&#8221;). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2.
