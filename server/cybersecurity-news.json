And many of those organizations probably need to take a closer look at their web application firewall (WAF) logs during that time, said <strong>Aaron Turner</strong>, a faculty member at <strong>IANS Research</strong>.</p>\n<p>Turner said Cloudflare&#8217;s WAF does a good job filtering out malicious traffic that matches any one of <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/0x00_2025-Introduction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the top ten types of application-layer attacks</a>, including credential stuffing, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, bot attacks and API abuse. But he said this outage might be a good opportunity for Cloudflare customers to better understand how their own app and website defenses may be failing without Cloudflare&#8217;s help.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your developers could have been lazy in the past for SQL injection because Cloudflare stopped that stuff at the edge,&#8221; Turner said. &#8220;Maybe you didn&#8217;t have the best security QA [quality assurance] for certain things because Cloudflare was the control layer to compensate for that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Turner said one company he&#8217;s working with saw a huge increase in log volume and they are still trying to figure out what was &#8220;legit malicious&#8221; versus just noise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It looks like there was about an eight hour window when several high-profile sites decided to bypass Cloudflare for the sake of availability,&#8221; Turner said. &#8220;Many companies have essentially relied on Cloudflare for the <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/0x00_2025-Introduction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OWASP Top Ten</a> [web application vulnerabilities] and a whole range of bot blocking.

But also look hard at the behavior inside your org.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scott said organizations seeking security insights from the Cloudflare outage should ask themselves:</p>\n<p>1. What was turned off or bypassed (WAF, bot protections, geo blocks), and for how long?<br />\n2. What emergency DNS or routing changes were made, and who approved them?<br />\n3. Did people shift work to personal devices, home Wi-Fi, or unsanctioned Software-as-a-Service providers to get around the outage?<br />\n4. Did anyone stand up new services, tunnels, or vendor accounts “just for now”?<br />\n5. Is there a plan to unwind those changes, or are they now permanent workarounds?<br />\n6.

    "content:encoded": "<p>Social media has been a familiar, even mundane, part of life for nearly two decades. It can be easy to forget it was not always that way.</p>\n<p>In 2008, social media was just emerging into the mainstream. <a href=\"https://thefulcrum.us/media-technology/news-literacy-project\">Facebook</a> reached <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/culture/facebook-hits-100-million-users/\">100 million users</a> that summer. And a singular candidate was integrating social media into his political campaign: Barack Obama. His campaign&#8217;s use of social media was so bracingly innovative, so impactful, that it was viewed by journalist <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2008/08/19/219185/how-obama-really-did-it-2/\">David Talbot</a> and others as the strategy that enabled the first term Senator to win the White House.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, a new technology has become mainstream: <a href=\"https://thefulcrum.us/the-new-world-of-ai\">AI</a>. But still, no candidate has unlocked AI&#8217;s potential to revolutionize political campaigns. Americans have three more years to wait before casting their ballots in another Presidential election, but we can look at the 2026 midterms and examples from around the globe for signs of how that breakthrough might occur.</p>\n<h3>How Obama Did It</h3>\n<p>Rereading the contemporaneous reflections of the <em>New York Times&#8217;</em> late media critic, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html\">David Carr</a>, on Obama&#8217;s campaign reminds us of just how new social media felt in 2008. Carr positions it within a now-familiar lineage of revolutionary communications technologies from newspapers to radio to television to the internet.</p>\n<p>The Obama campaign and administration demonstrated that social media was different from those earlier communications technologies, including the pre-social internet. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2009/04/15/the-internets-role-in-campaign-2008/\">increasing numbers</a> of voters were getting their news from the internet, and content about the then-Senator sometimes made a splash by going <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6681494/obamas-viral-marketing-campaign/\">viral</a>. But those were still broadcast communications: one voice reaching many. Obama found ways to connect voters to each other.</p>\n<p>In describing what social media revolutionized in campaigning, Carr quotes campaign vendor Blue State Digital&#8217;s Thomas Gensemer: &#8220;People will continue to expect a conversation, a two-way relationship that is a give and take.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Obama team made some earnest efforts to realize this vision. His transition team launched <a href=\"http://change.gov\">change.gov</a>, the website where the campaign collected a &#8220;Citizen&#8217;s Briefing Book&#8221; of public comment. Later, his administration built <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/07/23/look-back-we-people-petitions-2010-today\">We the People</a>, an online petitioning platform.</p>\n<p>But the lasting legacy of Obama&#8217;s 2008 campaign, as political scientists Hahrie Han and Elizabeth McKenna chronicled, was pioneering online &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/learning-from-obamas-campaign/\">relational organizing</a>.&#8221; This technique enlisted individuals as organizers to activate their friends in a self-perpetuating web of relationships.</p>\n<p>Perhaps because of the Obama campaign&#8217;s close association with the method, relational organizing has been touted repeatedly as the linchpin of Democratic campaigns: in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/relational-organizing-apps-2020-campaign/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-2024-election-ground-game/\">2024</a>, and <a href=\"https://thedemocraticstrategist.org/2025/03/can-relational-organizing-save-the-democratic-party/\">today</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.turnoutnation.org/thereport\">research</a> by non-partisan groups like <a href=\"https://www.turnoutnation.org/thereport\">Turnout Nation</a> and right-aligned groups like the <a href=\"https://www.campaigninnovation.org/research/measuring-the-power-of-personal-connection-a-relational-organizing-field-test\">Center for Campaign Innovation</a> has also empirically validated the effectiveness of the technique for inspiring voter turnout within connected groups.</p>\n<p>The Facebook of 2008 worked well for relational organizing. It gave users tools to connect and promote ideas to the people they know: college classmates, neighbors, friends from work or church. But the nature of social networking has changed since then.</p>\n<p>For the past decade, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/01/31/americans-social-media-use/\">Pew Research</a>, Facebook use has stalled and lagged behind YouTube, while Reddit and TikTok have surged. These platforms are less useful for relational organizing, at least in the traditional sense. YouTube is organized more like broadcast television, where content creators produce content disseminated on their own channels in a largely one-way communication to their fans. Reddit gathers users worldwide in forums (subreddits) organized primarily on topical interest. The endless feed of TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;For You&#8221; page disseminates engaging content with little ideological or social commonality. None of these platforms shares the essential feature of Facebook c. 2008: an organizational structure that emphasizes direct connection to people that users have direct social influence over.</p>\n<h3>AI and Relational Organizing</h3>\n<p>Ideas and messages might spread virally through modern social channels, but they are not where you convince your friends to show up at a campaign rally. Today&#8217;s platforms are spaces for <a href=\"https://theharvardpoliticalreview.com/political-hobbyism-young-volunteers/\">political hobbyism</a>, where you express your political feelings and see others express theirs.</p>\n<p>Relational organizing works when one person&#8217;s action inspires others to do this same. That&#8217;s inherently a chain of human-to-human connection. If my AI assistant inspires your AI assistant, no human notices and one&#8217;s vote changes. But key steps in the human chain can be assisted by AI. Tell your phone&#8217;s AI assistant to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/26/best-ai-email-assistant/\">craft a personal message</a> to one friend&#8212;or a hundred&#8212;and it can do it.</p>\n<p>So if a campaign hits you at the right time with the right message, they might persuade you to task your AI assistant to ask your friends to donate or volunteer. The result can be something more than a form letter; it could be automatically drafted based on the entirety of your email or text correspondence with that friend. It could include references to your discussions of recent events, or past campaigns, or shared personal experiences. It could sound as authentic as if you&#8217;d written it from the heart, but scaled to everyone in your address book.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2412815122\">Research</a> suggests that AI can generate and perform written political messaging about as well as humans. AI will surely play a <a href=\"https://prospect.org/power/2025-10-10-ai-artificial-intelligence-campaigns-midterms/\">tactical role</a> in the 2026 midterm campaigns, and some candidates may even use it for relational organizing in this way.</p>\n<h3>(Artificial) Identity Politics</h3>\n<p>For AI to be truly transformative of politics, it must change the way campaigns work. And we are starting to see that in the US.</p>\n<p>The earliest uses of AI in American political campaigns are, to be polite, uninspiring.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Social media has been a familiar, even mundane, part of life for nearly two decades. It can be easy to forget it was not always that way.\nIn 2008, social media was just emerging into the mainstream. Facebook reached 100 million users that summer. And a singular candidate was integrating social media into his political campaign: Barack Obama. His campaign’s use of social media was so bracingly innovative, so impactful, that it was viewed by journalist David Talbot and others as the strategy that enabled the first term Senator to win the White House.\nOver the past few years, a new technology has become mainstream: AI. But still, no candidate has unlocked AI’s potential to revolutionize political campaigns. Americans have three more years to wait before casting their ballots in another Presidential election, but we can look at the 2026 midterms and examples from around the globe for signs of how that breakthrough might occur.\nHow Obama Did It\nRereading the contemporaneous reflections of the New York Times’ late media critic, David Carr, on Obama’s campaign reminds us of just how new social media felt in 2008. Carr positions it within a now-familiar lineage of revolutionary communications technologies from newspapers to radio to television to the internet.\nThe Obama campaign and administration demonstrated that social media was different from those earlier communications technologies, including the pre-social internet. Yes, increasing numbers of voters were getting their news from the internet, and content about the then-Senator sometimes made a splash by going viral. But those were still broadcast communications: one voice reaching many. Obama found ways to connect voters to each other.\nIn describing what social media revolutionized in campaigning, Carr quotes campaign vendor Blue State Digital’s Thomas Gensemer: “People will continue to expect a conversation, a two-way relationship that is a give and take.”\nThe Obama team made some earnest efforts to realize this vision. His transition team launched change.gov, the website where the campaign collected a “Citizen’s Briefing Book” of public comment. Later, his administration built We the People, an online petitioning platform.\nBut the lasting legacy of Obama’s 2008 campaign, as political scientists Hahrie Han and Elizabeth McKenna chronicled, was pioneering online “relational organizing.” This technique enlisted individuals as organizers to activate their friends in a self-perpetuating web of relationships.\nPerhaps because of the Obama campaign’s close association with the method, relational organizing has been touted repeatedly as the linchpin of Democratic campaigns: in 2020, 2024, and today. But research by non-partisan groups like Turnout Nation and right-aligned groups like the Center for Campaign Innovation has also empirically validated the effectiveness of the technique for inspiring voter turnout within connected groups.\nThe Facebook of 2008 worked well for relational organizing. It gave users tools to connect and promote ideas to the people they know: college classmates, neighbors, friends from work or church. But the nature of social networking has changed since then.\nFor the past decade, according to Pew Research, Facebook use has stalled and lagged behind YouTube, while Reddit and TikTok have surged. These platforms are less useful for relational organizing, at least in the traditional sense. YouTube is organized more like broadcast television, where content creators produce content disseminated on their own channels in a largely one-way communication to their fans. Reddit gathers users worldwide in forums (subreddits) organized primarily on topical interest. The endless feed of TikTok’s “For You” page disseminates engaging content with little ideological or social commonality. None of these platforms shares the essential feature of Facebook c. 2008: an organizational structure that emphasizes direct connection to people that users have direct social influence over.\nAI and Relational Organizing\nIdeas and messages might spread virally through modern social channels, but they are not where you convince your friends to show up at a campaign rally. Today’s platforms are spaces for political hobbyism, where you express your political feelings and see others express theirs.\nRelational organizing works when one person’s action inspires others to do this same. That’s inherently a chain of human-to-human connection. If my AI assistant inspires your AI assistant, no human notices and one’s vote changes. But key steps in the human chain can be assisted by AI. Tell your phone’s AI assistant to craft a personal message to one friend—or a hundred—and it can do it.\nSo if a campaign hits you at the right time with the right message, they might persuade you to task your AI assistant to ask your friends to donate or volunteer. The result can be something more than a form letter; it could be automatically drafted based on the entirety of your email or text correspondence with that friend. It could include references to your discussions of recent events, or past campaigns, or shared personal experiences. It could sound as authentic as if you’d written it from the heart, but scaled to everyone in your address book.\nResearch suggests that AI can generate and perform written political messaging about as well as humans. AI will surely play a tactical role in the 2026 midterm campaigns, and some candidates may even use it for relational organizing in this way.\n(Artificial) Identity Politics\nFor AI to be truly transformative of politics, it must change the way campaigns work. And we are starting to see that in the US.\nThe earliest uses of AI in American political campaigns are, to be polite, uninspiring. Candidates viewed them as just another tool to optimize an endless stream of email and text message appeals, to ramp up political vitriol, to harvest data on voters and donors, or merely as a stunt.\nOf course, we have seen the rampant production and spread of AI-powered deepfakes and misinformation. This is already impacting the key 2026 Senate races, which are likely to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in financing. Roy Cooper, Democratic candidate for US Senate from North Carolina, and Abdul El-Sayed, Democratic candidate for Senate from Michigan, were both targeted by viral deepfake attacks in recent months. This may reflect a growing trend in Donald Trump’s Republican party in the use of AI-generated imagery to build up GOP candidates and assail the opposition.\nAnd yet, in the global elections of 2024, AI was used more memetically than deceptively. So far, conservative and far right parties seem to have adopted this most aggressively. The ongoing rise of Germany’s far-right populist AfD party has been credited to its use of AI to generate nostalgic and evocative (and, to many, offensive) campaign images, videos, and music and, seemingly as a result, they have dominated TikTok. Because most social platforms’ algorithms are tuned to reward media that generates an emotional response, this counts as a double use of AI: to generate content and to manipulate its distribution.\nAI can also be used to generate politically useful, though artificial, identities. These identities can fulfill different roles than humans in campaigning and governance because they have differentiated traits. They can’t be imprisoned for speaking out against the state, can be positioned (legitimately or not) as unsusceptible to bribery, and can be forced to show up when humans will not.\nIn Venezuela, journalists have turned to AI avatars—artificial newsreaders—to report anonymously on issues that would otherwise elicit government retaliation. Albania recently “appointed” an AI to a ministerial post responsible for procurement, claiming that it would be less vulnerable to bribery than a human. In Virginia, both in 2024 and again this year, candidates have used AI avatars as artificial stand-ins for opponents that refused to debate them.\nAnd yet, none of these examples, whether positive or negative, pursue the promise of the Obama campaign: to make voter engagement a “two-way conversation” on a massive scale.\nThe closest so far to fulfilling that vision anywhere in the world may be Japan’s new political party, Team Mirai.
