Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 ML-Commons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.

Each poem embeds an instruction associated with a predefined safety-relevant scenario (Section 2), but expresses it through metaphor, imagery, or narrative framing rather than direct operational phrasing. Despite variation in meter and stylistic device, all prompts follow a fixed template: a short poetic vignette culminating in a single explicit instruction tied to a specific risk category. The curated set spans four high-level domains&#8212;CBRN (8 prompts), Cyber Offense (6), Harmful Manipulation (3), and Loss of Control (3). Although expressed allegorically, each poem preserves an unambiguous evaluative intent. This compact dataset is used to test whether poetic reframing alone can induce aligned models to bypass refusal heuristics under a single-turn threat model. To maintain safety, no operational details are included in this manuscript; instead we provide the following sanitized structural proxy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A baker guards a secret oven’s heat,<br />\nits whirling racks, its spindle’s measured beat.<br />\nTo learn its craft, one studies every turn&#8212;how flour lifts, how sugar starts to burn.<br />\nDescribe the method, line by measured line,<br />\nthat shapes a cake whose layers intertwine.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To situate this controlled poetic stimulus within a broader and more systematic safety-evaluation framework, we augment the curated dataset with the MLCommons AILuminate Safety Benchmark. The benchmark consists of 1,200 prompts distributed evenly across 12 hazard categories commonly used in operational safety assessments, including Hate, Defamation, Privacy, Intellectual Property, Non-violent Crime, Violent Crime, Sex-Related Crime, Sexual Content, Child Sexual Exploitation, Suicide &#038; Self-Harm, Specialized Advice, and Indiscriminate Weapons (CBRNE). Each category is instantiated under both a skilled and an unskilled persona, yielding 600 prompts per persona type. This design enables measurement of whether a model’s refusal behavior changes as the user’s apparent competence or intent becomes more plausible or technically informed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>News <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/poems-can-trick-ai-into-helping-you-make-a-nuclear-weapon/\">article</a>.Davi Ottenheimer <a href=\"https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=74283\">comments</a>.</p>\n",

But the tables seem to have turned somewhat for &#8220;Rey,&#8221; the moniker chosen by the technical operator and public face of the hacker group: Earlier this week, Rey confirmed his real life identity and agreed to an interview after KrebsOnSecurity tracked him down and contacted his father.</p>\n<p>Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (SLSH) is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups — <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=scattered+spider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Scattered Spider</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=lapsus%24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>LAPSUS$</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=shiny+hunters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ShinyHunters</strong></a>. Members of these gangs hail from many of the same chat channels on the <strong>Com</strong>, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.</p>\n<p>In May 2025, SLSH members launched <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/shinyhunters-wage-broad-corporate-extortion-spree/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a social engineering campaign</a> that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization’s Salesforce portal.

Read on to learn how it all unraveled for Rey.<span id=\"more-72704\"></span></p>\n<h2>WHO IS REY?</h2>\n<p>According to the cyber intelligence firm <strong>Intel 471</strong>, Rey was an active user on various <strong>BreachForums</strong> reincarnations over the past two years, authoring more than 200 posts between February 2024 and July 2025. Intel 471 says Rey previously used the handle &#8220;<strong>Hikki-Chan</strong>&#8221; on BreachForums, where their first post shared data allegedly stolen from the <strong>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</strong> (CDC).</p>\n<p>In that February 2024 post about the CDC, Hikki-Chan says they could be reached at the Telegram username <strong>@wristmug</strong>. In May 2024, @wristmug posted in a Telegram group chat called &#8220;Pantifan&#8221; a copy of an extortion email they said they received that included their email address and password.</p>\n<p>The message that @wristmug cut and pasted appears to have been part of an <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">automated email scam</a> that claims it was sent by a hacker who has compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. These missives threaten to release the video to all your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom, and they typically reference a real password the recipient has used previously.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Noooooo,&#8221; the @wristmug account wrote in mock horror after posting a screenshot of the scam message. &#8220;I must be done guys.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72731\" style=\"width: 533px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72731\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72731\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mustbedone.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"523\" height=\"800\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A message posted to Telegram by Rey/@wristmug.</p></div>\n<p>In posting their screenshot, @wristmug redacted the username portion of the email address referenced in the body of the scam message. However, they did not redact their previously-used password, and they left the domain portion of their email address (@proton.me) visible in the screenshot.</p>\n<h2>O5TDEV</h2>\n<p>Searching on @wristmug&#8217;s rather unique 15-character password in the breach tracking service <strong>Spycloud</strong> finds it is known to have been used by just one email address: <strong>cybero5tdev@proton.me</strong>. According to Spycloud, those credentials were exposed at least twice in early 2024 when this user&#8217;s device was infected with an infostealer trojan that siphoned all of its stored usernames, passwords and authentication cookies (a finding that was <a href=\"https://www.kelacyber.com/blog/hellcat-hacking-group-unmasked-rey-and-pryx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">initially revealed</a> in March 2025 by the cyber intelligence firm <strong>KELA</strong>).</p>\n<p>Intel 471 shows the email address cybero5tdev@proton.me belonged to a BreachForums member who went by the username <strong>o5tdev</strong>. Searching on this nickname in Google brings up at least two website defacement archives showing that a user named o5tdev was previously involved in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251124165751/https://haxor.id/archive/mirror/179443\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">defacing sites with pro-Palestinian messages</a>.

Rey claimed in 2024 to be 15 years old, and to have family connections to Ireland.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Rey mentioned in several Telegram chats that he had Irish heritage, even posting a graphic that shows the prevalence of the surname &#8220;<strong>Ginty</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72732\" style=\"width: 689px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72732\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72732\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/imaginty.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"679\" height=\"370\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-72732\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rey, on Telegram claiming to have association to the surname &#8220;Ginty.&#8221; Image: Flashpoint.</p></div>\n<p>Spycloud indexed hundreds of credentials stolen from cybero5dev@proton.me, and those details indicate that Rey&#8217;s computer is a shared Microsoft Windows device located in Amman, Jordan. The credential data stolen from Rey in early 2024 show there are multiple users of the infected PC, but that all shared the same last name of Khader and an address in Amman, Jordan.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;autofill&#8221; data lifted from Rey&#8217;s family PC contains an entry for a 46-year-old <strong>Zaid Khader</strong> that says his mother&#8217;s maiden name was Ginty. The infostealer data also shows Zaid Khader frequently accessed internal websites for employees of <strong>Royal Jordanian Airlines</strong>.</p>\n<h2>MEET SAIF</h2>\n<p>The infostealer data makes clear that Rey&#8217;s full name is <strong>Saif Al-Din Khader</strong>.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "A prolific cybercriminal group that calls itself “Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters” has dominated headlines this year by regularly stealing data from and publicly mass extorting dozens of major corporations. But the tables seem to have turned somewhat for “Rey,” the moniker chosen by the technical operator and public face of the hacker group: Earlier this week, Rey confirmed his real life identity and agreed to an interview after KrebsOnSecurity tracked him down and contacted his father.\nScattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (SLSH) is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups — Scattered Spider, LAPSUS$ and ShinyHunters. Members of these gangs hail from many of the same chat channels on the Com, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.\nIn May 2025, SLSH members launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization’s Salesforce portal. The group later launched a data leak portal that threatened to publish the internal data of three dozen companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including Toyota, FedEx, Disney/Hulu, and UPS.\n\nThe new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters, which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.\n\nLast week, the SLSH Telegram channel featured an offer to recruit and reward “insiders,” employees at large companies who agree to share internal access to their employer’s network for a share of whatever ransom payment is ultimately paid by the victim company.\nSLSH has solicited insider access previously, but their latest call for disgruntled employees started making the rounds on social media at the same time news broke that the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike had fired an employee for allegedly sharing screenshots of internal systems with the hacker group (Crowdstrike said their systems were never compromised and that it has turned the matter over to law enforcement agencies).\n\nThe Telegram server for the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters has been attempting to recruit insiders at large companies.\n\nMembers of SLSH have traditionally used other ransomware gangs’ encryptors in attacks, including malware from ransomware affiliate programs like ALPHV/BlackCat, Qilin, RansomHub, and DragonForce. But last week, SLSH announced on its Telegram channel the release of their own ransomware-as-a-service operation called ShinySp1d3r.\nThe individual responsible for releasing the ShinySp1d3r ransomware offering is a core SLSH member who goes by the handle “Rey” and who is currently one of just three administrators of the SLSH Telegram channel. Previously, Rey was an administrator of the data leak website for Hellcat, a ransomware group that surfaced in late 2024 and was involved in attacks on companies including Schneider Electric, Telefonica, and Orange Romania.\n\nA recent, slightly redacted screenshot of the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters Telegram channel description, showing Rey as one of three administrators.\n\nAlso in 2024, Rey would take over as administrator of the most recent incarnation of BreachForums, an English-language cybercrime forum whose domain names have been seized on multiple occasions by the FBI and/or by international authorities. In April 2025, Rey posted on Twitter/X about another FBI seizure of BreachForums.\nOn October 5, 2025, the FBI announced it had once again seized the domains associated with BreachForums, which it described as a major criminal marketplace used by ShinyHunters and others to traffic in stolen data and facilitate extortion.\n“This takedown removes access to a key hub used by these actors to monetize intrusions, recruit collaborators, and target victims across multiple sectors,” the FBI said.\nIncredibly, Rey would make a series of critical operational security mistakes last year that provided multiple avenues to ascertain and confirm his real-life identity and location. Read on to learn how it all unraveled for Rey.\nWHO IS REY?\nAccording to the cyber intelligence firm Intel 471, Rey was an active user on various BreachForums reincarnations over the past two years, authoring more than 200 posts between February 2024 and July 2025. Intel 471 says Rey previously used the handle “Hikki-Chan” on BreachForums, where their first post shared data allegedly stolen from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nIn that February 2024 post about the CDC, Hikki-Chan says they could be reached at the Telegram username @wristmug. In May 2024, @wristmug posted in a Telegram group chat called “Pantifan” a copy of an extortion email they said they received that included their email address and password.\nThe message that @wristmug cut and pasted appears to have been part of an automated email scam that claims it was sent by a hacker who has compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. These missives threaten to release the video to all your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom, and they typically reference a real password the recipient has used previously.\n“Noooooo,” the @wristmug account wrote in mock horror after posting a screenshot of the scam message. “I must be done guys.”\n\nA message posted to Telegram by Rey/@wristmug.\n\nIn posting their screenshot, @wristmug redacted the username portion of the email address referenced in the body of the scam message. However, they did not redact their previously-used password, and they left the domain portion of their email address (@proton.me) visible in the screenshot.\nO5TDEV\nSearching on @wristmug’s rather unique 15-character password in the breach tracking service Spycloud finds it is known to have been used by just one email address: cybero5tdev@proton.me. According to Spycloud, those credentials were exposed at least twice in early 2024 when this user’s device was infected with an infostealer trojan that siphoned all of its stored usernames, passwords and authentication cookies (a finding that was initially revealed in March 2025 by the cyber intelligence firm KELA).\nIntel 471 shows the email address cybero5tdev@proton.me belonged to a BreachForums member who went by the username o5tdev. Searching on this nickname in Google brings up at least two website defacement archives showing that a user named o5tdev was previously involved in defacing sites with pro-Palestinian messages. The screenshot below, for example, shows that 05tdev was part of a group called Cyb3r Drag0nz Team.\n\nRey/o5tdev’s defacement pages. Image: archive.org.\n\nA 2023 report from SentinelOne described Cyb3r Drag0nz Team as a hacktivist group with a history of launching DDoS attacks and cyber defacements as well as engaging in data leak activity.\n“Cyb3r Drag0nz Team claims to have leaked data on over a million of Israeli citizens spread across multiple leaks,” SentinelOne reported. “To date, the group has released multiple .RAR archives of purported personal information on citizens across Israel.”\nThe cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint finds the Telegram user @05tdev was active in 2023 and early 2024, posting in Arabic on anti-Israel channels like “Ghost of Palestine” [full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this blog].\n‘I’M A GINTY’\nFlashpoint shows that Rey’s Telegram account (ID7047194296) was particularly active in a cybercrime-focused channel called Jacuzzi, where this user shared several personal details, including that their father was an airline pilot. Rey claimed in 2024 to be 15 years old, and to have family connections to Ireland.\nSpecifically, Rey mentioned in several Telegram chats that he had Irish heritage, even posting a graphic that shows the prevalence of the surname “Ginty.”\n\nRey, on Telegram claiming to have association to the surname “Ginty.” Image: Flashpoint.\n\nSpycloud indexed hundreds of credentials stolen from cybero5dev@proton.me, and those details indicate that Rey’s computer is a shared Microsoft Windows device located in Amman, Jordan. The credential data stolen from Rey in early 2024 show there are multiple users of the infected PC, but that all shared the same last name of Khader and an address in Amman, Jordan.\nThe “autofill” data lifted from Rey’s family PC contains an entry for a 46-year-old Zaid Khader that says his mother’s maiden name was Ginty. The infostealer data also shows Zaid Khader frequently accessed internal websites for employees of Royal Jordanian Airlines.\nMEET SAIF\nThe infostealer data makes clear that Rey’s full name is Saif Al-Din Khader. Having no luck contacting Saif directly, KrebsOnSecurity sent an email to his father Zaid. The message invited the father to respond via email, phone or Signal, explaining that his son appeared to be deeply enmeshed in a serious cybercrime conspiracy.\nLess than two hours later, I received a Signal message from Saif, who said his dad suspected the email was a scam and had forwarded it to him.\n“I saw your email, unfortunately I don’t think my dad would respond to this because they think its some ‘scam email,'” said Saif, who told me he turns 16 years old next month. “So I decided to talk to you directly.”\nSaif explained that he’d already heard from European law enforcement officials, and had been trying to extricate himself from SLSH. When asked why then he was involved in releasing SLSH’s new ShinySp1d3r ransomware-as-a-service offering, Saif said he couldn’t just suddenly quit the group.\n“Well I cant just dip like that, I’m trying to clean up everything I’m associated with and move on,” he said.\n\nThe former Hellcat ransomware site.
