This book event, with Danielle Allen at the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center, is particularly good.  We also have been doing a ton of podcasts, both separately and together. They’re all on the book’s homepage.\nThere are two live book events in December. If you’re in Boston, come see us at the MIT Museum on 12/1. If you’re in Toronto, you can see me at the Munk School at the University of Toronto on 12/2.\nI’m also doing a live AMA on the book on the RSA Conference website on 12/16. Register here.",
