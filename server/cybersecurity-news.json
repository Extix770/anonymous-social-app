    "content:encoded": "<p>More than a decade after <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Open-access-tributes-to-Aaron-Swartz-4193965.php\">Aaron Swartz&#8217;s death</a>, the United States is still living inside the contradiction that destroyed him.</p>\n<p>Swartz believed that knowledge, especially publicly funded knowledge, should be freely accessible. Acting on that, he downloaded thousands of academic articles from the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/\">JSTOR</a> archive with the intention of making them publicly available. For this, the federal government charged him with a felony and threatened decades in prison. After two years of prosecutorial pressure, Swartz died by suicide on Jan. 11, 2013.</p>\n<p>The still-unresolved questions raised by his case have resurfaced in today&#8217;s debates over artificial intelligence, copyright and the ultimate control of knowledge.</p>\n<p>At the time of Swartz&#8217;s prosecution, vast amounts of research were funded by taxpayers, conducted at public institutions and intended to advance public understanding. But access to that research was, and still is, locked behind expensive paywalls. People are unable to read work they helped fund without paying private journals and research websites.</p>\n<p>Swartz considered this hoarding of knowledge to be neither accidental nor inevitable. It was the result of legal, economic and political choices. His actions challenged those choices directly. And for that, the government treated him as a criminal.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s AI arms race involves a far more expansive, profit-driven form of information appropriation. The tech giants ingest vast amounts of copyrighted material: books, journalism, academic papers, art, music and personal writing. This data is scraped at industrial scale, often without consent, compensation or transparency, and then used to train large AI models.</p>\n<p>AI companies then sell their proprietary systems, built on public and private knowledge, back to the people who funded it. But this time, the government&#8217;s response has been markedly different. There are no criminal prosecutions, no threats of decades-long prison sentences. Lawsuits proceed slowly, enforcement remains uncertain and policymakers signal caution, given AI&#8217;s perceived economic and strategic importance. Copyright infringement is reframed as an unfortunate but necessary step toward &#8220;innovation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Recent developments underscore this imbalance. In 2025, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529404/anthropic-settlement-authors-copyright-ai\">Anthropic</a> reached a settlement with publishers over allegations that its AI systems were trained on copyrighted books without authorization. The agreement reportedly valued infringement at roughly $3,000 per book across an estimated 500,000 works, coming at a cost of over $1.5 billion. Plagiarism disputes between artists and accused infringers routinely settle for hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars when prominent works are involved. Scholars estimate Anthropic avoided over <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/anthropic-s-settlement-shows-the-u.s.-can-t-afford-ai-copyright-lawsuits\">$1 trillion in liability costs</a>.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "More than a decade after Aaron Swartz’s death, the United States is still living inside the contradiction that destroyed him.\nSwartz believed that knowledge, especially publicly funded knowledge, should be freely accessible. Acting on that, he downloaded thousands of academic articles from the JSTOR archive with the intention of making them publicly available. For this, the federal government charged him with a felony and threatened decades in prison. After two years of prosecutorial pressure, Swartz died by suicide on Jan. 11, 2013.\nThe still-unresolved questions raised by his case have resurfaced in today’s debates over artificial intelligence, copyright and the ultimate control of knowledge.\nAt the time of Swartz’s prosecution, vast amounts of research were funded by taxpayers, conducted at public institutions and intended to advance public understanding. But access to that research was, and still is, locked behind expensive paywalls. People are unable to read work they helped fund without paying private journals and research websites.\nSwartz considered this hoarding of knowledge to be neither accidental nor inevitable. It was the result of legal, economic and political choices. His actions challenged those choices directly. And for that, the government treated him as a criminal.\nToday’s AI arms race involves a far more expansive, profit-driven form of information appropriation. The tech giants ingest vast amounts of copyrighted material: books, journalism, academic papers, art, music and personal writing. This data is scraped at industrial scale, often without consent, compensation or transparency, and then used to train large AI models.\nAI companies then sell their proprietary systems, built on public and private knowledge, back to the people who funded it. But this time, the government’s response has been markedly different. There are no criminal prosecutions, no threats of decades-long prison sentences. Lawsuits proceed slowly, enforcement remains uncertain and policymakers signal caution, given AI’s perceived economic and strategic importance. Copyright infringement is reframed as an unfortunate but necessary step toward “innovation.”\nRecent developments underscore this imbalance. In 2025, Anthropic reached a settlement with publishers over allegations that its AI systems were trained on copyrighted books without authorization. The agreement reportedly valued infringement at roughly $3,000 per book across an estimated 500,000 works, coming at a cost of over $1.5 billion. Plagiarism disputes between artists and accused infringers routinely settle for hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars when prominent works are involved. Scholars estimate Anthropic avoided over $1 trillion in liability costs. For well-capitalized AI firms, such settlements are likely being factored as a predictable cost of doing business.\nAs AI becomes a larger part of America’s economy, one can see the writing on the wall.
